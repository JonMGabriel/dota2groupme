Fun time in world.
remember when andy was a chen and i was a riki and i caught him in a corner on level 1.
remember when we casted 1v1s.
what I would give to see andy draw a whole trial with someone narrating over the different pictures.
the deepest desire.
i long to see NBC9 using your pictures.
andy pls.
Andy are you getting in to law so you can be one of those courtroom artists?
I have an uncle "Dicky".
thats pretty funny.
our family calls him uncle dick.
my dad's friend's name is richard but everyone calls him dick.
Story was 3/10. No dick in mouth pics .
which I appreciated.
yea you guys woke me up to join in.
it was ok but we compensated with puns.
I hoped there was more to it.
meh*.
we did.
it was kinda meg.
Also did we ever get Jon's story.
God I miss Andy's drawings.
what happened to "andy draws things" fridays.
me too.
I'd rather see andy draw twine.
i bet andy could find a way to spell twine without twin.
Coincidence? I think not.
Guys you can't spell twine without twin.
too lazy to do the pics.
ez twine.
Andy you bastard.
Oh shit. Then that once night we promised not to talk about was wincest.
Under what circumstances were we separated #clue.
Oh shit! 
Cute.
#who is mikes long lost twin brudder.
"this pen isn't a bic".
no no no this doesn't add up at all.
I was like, wait...mike doesn't have a twin brother...
I'm an idiot. I was very impressed for a span of 30 seconds from that picture without seeing the red writing.
Disageee.
thinking "that tie did not go well with that suit".
Yeah it is, actually. My twin bro knows what I'm thinking .
What if they both suck.
iceMasterchief pls nerf.
that strat seems OP.

Jon could you say something nerdier?
anyone ever catch the theory that he played baseball to avoid some charges of betting on basketball?
MLB.
More like wrath (deal 3 damage or deal 1 damage and draw a card).

You could have lived it.
Also did someone link Matt's popular reddit post yet. I would like to read it.
He wasn't as good as a wiz tho.

Then Erika, Ronnie parents, Matts pig and I are gonna play halo on the weekends.
>Well played!
Plus, I'm gonna make such a compelling imminent map everybody is going to buy themselves and any potential house mates an Xbox to play it. I won't have to worry about it much longer... Assuming Forge doesn't keep breaking my maps. 
But Mike.
Their doto team has an old man and a super young wildcard and a handsome east Indian man and then two people made of salt and rage.
And maintained the disgust levels .
Got a squad of kids who were disgusting in halo 3 days.
Same with their doto team.
Yeah they are top ranked.
Does EG have a halo team?
#gif halo 360 no scope .
I know I would like it too, but I'm just beginning to hit my halo stride. Ronnie and I are going to join EG and fly to Columbus Ohio.

The "poop" to "fuck work" proves Oracle works. We often talk about pooping at work, when talking about work it's mostly bitter.

Ham u didn't cut off her arm right.
She's got this huge tattoo on her arm of a bonobo. Brb lemme snag it.
Shelby samartino sounds like a real smart-arino.
Nice!
#what did Jon see.
Did u see her nekkid.
That girl I was with. Her name is shelby samartino. Shes real neat. Last year she spent a full year in the congo researching bonobos. She lives in Texas now and is applying to phd programs across the country. Always had a thing for her but probably won't turn into anything more.

Was there any allchat after that?

#oracle mike sucks.
Godspeed Woody.
ok that makes a lot of sesne.
I'm gonna check and report back.
Except if interrupted by a "doesn't".
Agreed.
Mike sucks is probably uncommon.
Yea, its a score for each word. The score of "result words" are multiplied by the source word's score. So if "Lemon" leads to "Bitch" that relationship would have a .99 multiplier while "Mike" to "Sucks" would have a .07 which deemphasizes common words while promoting more obscure relationships.
Probably science.
how uncommon they are?

You wouldnt get cosplay girls to do a porno.
Hi Jon.

If you went to the Superbowl with 50k you could get like a hotdog and a Styrofoam cup of miller lite.
You could prob get some slutty cosplay girls to do a porno. Ez profit .
Yee.
Two crystal maidens at one time.
Like, if you went to TI with 50k to blow you could do some pretty ridiculous shit.
Id pocket the other 20k.
I'd give Jon 45k to make me a movie.
Then I'd post it on reddit and easily make the 50k back.
Lol id just do an epic 5 min video of a jewish kid going to a strip club with 30k and makin it rain on some hoes .
I'd go to a dota tournament and film the whole experience and indulge in everything.
I would make a documentary about wasting 50k.
If someone gave me 50k I could do a lot better than jewish kid experiences christmas.
Lol jews.

#oracle butter tart.
I'd elect you mayor of buttertart.
I'm in buttertart town.
Youre right.
They aren't.
If people are smart enough to not die.
I think offvoid is the new hot thing.
woot!
Not me!
Is everyone working again? Wtf.
And I think the way you wanna use him is to counter initiate right? Once everyone blows the first stun, you jump in (on your team as well) and chrono. Then use the cooldown freeze which gives everyone like a 20% slow.
that could be nonsense, the confidence here is like 50%. Maybe an item for Mana? The Timewalk low cooldown makes it nice to spam if you had the pool to.
So I would go Treads -> Blink -> MoM -> Aghs?
maybe MoM to kill supports.
Into Aghs.
And a team who can take advtange of Chrono.
or Aether to give u more distance.
I think you need Blink.
So far I've seen 2 people do it badly.
im curious to give fv offlane a run.
you need dope tree micro to make it work.
People used to run him off lane .
so i can't see why not.
he only gets run offlane in pro games.
Can NP run the offlane? New stack there for taking with trees and TP into other lanes for mad ganks? or is that horseshit and would just get stomped.
Ez.
forgot that was a change.
i actually made someone disjoint shackle the other day with a glimmer cape.
you know it.
Were you puck.
turned a few teamfights.
I'm telling you, it was really good.
also provides vision.
and it heals DP which I didn't know.
yes.
is it like razor where nothing breaks it but distance?
and 800 distance is pretty far.
I played against DP and it was really effective at slowing people getting away from the ult.

Duh.
Suck off during ult.
is it ult then suck off everyone?

Similar to playing against a razor.

And told him he's the simplest hero in the game.

You should've made him play earth spirit.
yeah, i figured between the three choices it would be a good one to learn about magic vs physical damage.

Lina's kind of tough, but you get to learn about skillshots.
and then played a second game as venge (my choice).
he went lina.
and then in the guided bot matches has you choose between luna sven and lina.

does that even make sense.
how the deuce is the diffuser constant cross-sectional area.
#gif zubat.
"it's really complicated i promise".
The supersonic diffuser is a straight, constant-cross-sectional-area duct with a length
equal to 10 test section heights. Within the supersonic diffuser, the flow passes
through, in all likelihood, a series of complicated shock waves. Before leaving the
supersonic diffuser, the flow should have slowed to subsonic speeds.
They are just blenders.

Clearly you haven't read the novel "gone with the wind" - This is gonna have novel parts.

i'll just put a picture of andy on it so it can really blow.
I've got big plans for this new venture.
A couple lightning bolts.
I'm assuming we'll throw some Flame Decals on them?
I think matt's contract includes a bill of employee rights.
You need Wind? Walk outside. What you need is a STU STEEN WIND TUNNELLLL BOOOOYYYYY.
does your employment contract have "Terns and Conditions" matt?
also, they don't want to use any pressure relief valves, so their supply tanks only go to 230 psi.
I'll sell the Wind Tunnels with a "Can Do" attitude.
I have some terns too.
Even a couple gulls.
we can do it stu.
Sty if u need to test the wind tunnel I can supply a few ducks.
you can make windtunnels and i'll rub them with my hands to keep them warm.
You won't.
"Instead of supersonic wind tunnel, box contained bobcat. 4/5 stars would not buy again".
half inclined to compete with them when I finish school.
That'll teach em.
Leave them a mean review on Yelp.
right?
what is this magical product theyve invented.
that barely scratches the surface of how little they know.
wat.
that the flow through the test section will be room temp.
that without any heating whatsoever.
so they told us.
i think when you're selling supersonic parts faking it is ill advised.
yea that's what it's like.
Fake it till you make I always say.
Ah Sales.
but over the past week we've realized that they have no fucking clue what theyre talking about.
they advertise a movable block so you can vary the range from 1.4 - 4.
we've been working with them to possibly acquire a supersonic tunnel from them.
Sty pls.
i desperately need you to go on.
the people at aerolab are the biggest fucking scrubs.

#oracle semen.
i sort of remember the pushing into the middle. i think jon said that.
Then when searching back into the history, it couldn't find another reference of "pushes" with "Semen" involved because it took out the "*".
Evidently we don't talk about semen enough .
While processing words, sUN strips out the "*" character so it becomes ["pushes", "it", "into", "the", "middle", "."].
One of those references led to "*pushes it into the middle*.".
Apparently "Semen" has only been used twice in the history of the GroupMe.
If anyone is wondering what the "Semen" but was it was very obscure.

I'm trying to be clever but I'm also sleepy.
look up the LINEST function.
like you have to ln all the y's or some bullshit then it's a linear fit then the a becomes the exponent and you cry in the shower so you're not sure what's water and what's tears.

Andy when are you back in delawhat.
i crushed him when i duel laned as a bounty.
i think you counter him by just duel laning.
Slash as good.
It wouldn't be good mid.
Better against offlaners. It's weak when you can stand in a wave. 
he does harass well.
Ez dives with evasion aoe.
Pos 4 wrecked me. Impossible to offlane against zet. The q wrecks, can't run. 
not viper.
everyone gets wrecked by glowballs.
he gets rekt by glowballs.
risk*.
no risj.
send illusion to do the rapier work.
And always be way behind the fight.
Maybe its Midas, Yasha, Rapier.
nah you should still stay mid, and just roam in to the jungle with your ult to farm.
its like having an antimage mid.
Cause you wanna be near a large creep every 55 seconds.
then your mid isnt contributing.
and if you are sending him mid.
you should almost move into the jungle.
but you still need the rest of your team to do stuff for you.
yea, once you have midas.
so midas is good.
hmmm.
so you get to use midas every 55 sec.
totally missed this the other day
http://www.polygon.com/2015/12/9/9881140/mst3k-kickstarter-rick-and-morty-the-simpsons-ernie-cline.
right?
ohhhh.
so you can spawn and use Midas 2 times while main hero uses it once.
Yeah.
"When the duplicate is created, all of its available items and normal abilities are off cooldown." on a 55 second cooldown.
this guy doesnt contribute shit.
venge is viable because she contributes early.
i disagree.
and he can totally carry in the right hands. if venge is a viable carry then this guy is way more viable.
?
Triple.
true, he gets double value from midas.
he farms stupid fast with that.
points 4 and 5 are countered by midas.
andy.andy.
dead hero.
IMO 
1) he can't support
2) he's a lackluster mid
3) he doesn't really makes sense as a carry
4) he needs a lot of farm to be an effective pusher
5) he can't really get a lot of farm, because none of his skills really help him farm faster.
hook is super reliable. do better.
*4.
but it's so spammable that you can place them on top of each other and have a 900 damage bomb for someone at lvl 3.
yeah true.
but its also not as reliable.
yeah, its even more than Shadow Shamans q, which is 140.
other than hook.
probably the highest lvl 1 nuke in the game.
thats true.
150 damage at lvl 1 is a lot.
Hmm. Hmmmmmmm.
but 300 is just like above average.
if they did a lot of damage, then sure.
they seem like kind've a moderate nuke.
if you position them right you can put them in places where only the hero would hit them.
They attack creeps. How do you use them to bully out?
plus they're so spammable and do pretty decent damage that you can easily get kills / bully someone out of lane.
if you position them correctly you either lock in the enemy mid or force them to take damage.
Tower dive with evasion too.
yeah or to harass.
setup ghosts to prevent ganks i guess?
Both of you have convinced me. No manta, go mid. Solved.
yeah that and the ghosts give him a lot of lane control.
whether thats against another mid or in the safelane against an offlaner idk.
i do think he's best against 1 other person because of his first skill.
I think he needs to be played as a mid.
he has no escape other than the bubble, which only protects you from rightclick.
i'm probably just salty from the 5 games i played where people picked him on my team and then proceeded to suck ass.
can't really run him offlane IMO.
so its two 3 man fights?
maybe if you're team is pushing either lane you have one version of him in both.
i guess.
i'll be curious to see what build the #1 guy ends up doing.
I think he has to be used to push.
BoT is core (the ability to spawn a duplicate with BoT on cooldown allows you to use it twice).
on dotabuff no one has the minimum number of games with the hero to be ranked yet.
idk, i won't believe he's useful until i see it.
yeah maybe.
So he's #2 as a utility hero. Maybe run him 2-1-2 in the offlane? Go Midas into necro into Hex/DAGON!
helps her as a carry, but also helps her team if you play her support.
like venge aura.
but that still benefits everyone on your team.
with the one exception of the bubble.
which also makes sense, since none of his skills are carry based.
i could see a utility build definitely.
Maybe hex? Double hex would be hot.
manta is worse on ranged heroes.
I think he's right. No manta.
plus he's ranged.
Ok Andy sold me.
sure there's a lot of them out there, but they dont do any damage and die super fast.
its like having 6 illusions of a support.
*your.
if you go necro, you're illusions suck.
they are not.
i've seen it.
Necro and manta are viable though because of his ult.
like deso or some shit.
manta into other rightclick items.
or instead go normal agi righclick build.
If you go as a 1 you can go Midas crit bkb sheep BoTs.
and in that case go necro vlads AC.
Never.
either make him a utility aura hero.
pick one.
why are you building necro and manta.
Your an awful build.
I'd say that build if you want his as a 2.
i think thats an awful build.
In that order.
Midas, necro, travels, manta.
still though wht items do you go?
yeah he can split push like mad.
his mid winrate is 27%.
his safelane winrate is the best, at 43%.
Crazy split pushing skills.
people have been playing his as a support and it makes no sense.
Fast Midas, into necro.
he's either a 1 or 2.
yeah because people don't know how to play him.
Safe lane as a 1.
his mid winrate is worst of all though.
he's strong enough in lane to get that fast midas if he's not ganked.
I think he works best as a mid, good harass and does well 1on1.
how are you even supposed to build him?
i've yet to see him played well.
its terrible.
micro2hard.
lol according to Dotabuff Zet's winrate is 36.81%.
lol.
ez double pulls osfrog pls.
can toss a creep to mid and force the other to bot.
and then once you get a force staff gg.
yeah, maybe.
would probably work for pulling mid too.

pudge can pull it too with hook.

I'm thinking Puck for solo offlane as an initiator with teams who can follow its Ult.
Yea, the most INT the guy stole was like 4 which wasn't enough to matter.  Usually its like 16.
Normally you want to max e before using q, so it's hard to really lane dominate. Esp because you probably need at least 3 in q before it really is annoying.
New OD was super underwhelming. I don't think the guy I played against knew how to use it though.
odd.
It did make for some slightly longer dismembers though which was od.
I don't think it was extending my blink but it's so habit I don't know if I would have noticed.
I think lens was extending the range of euls (by extension, items with range) when I was playing with it. Is that the case.
Space or the insides of a neuron? ~~yOu DeCiDe~~.

With blink your range is already so high.

@John Galt Unrelated but NRL has this super cool robotics lab. I can't go inside but there's this big ass greenhouse attached which is a simulated jungle they use for testing autonomous vehicles in tropical environments .
We definitely have printers here but I think the scanners would be in Knoxville .
I'd bet you a dollar Tennessee has one too. Get me a model and I'll print you. @Woody your dad specifically requested a bust of himself.
At least it's been around for a while .

so I dunno where this 2 bird nonsense is coming from.
I'm not gonna read all of that so I'm gonna heart it instead.
As a bird guy I would have hoped you would have noticed there are 7 birds and 4 types of birds.
Guys I think sun needs some work because this may come as a shock to you but despite having requested a gif of three trees sun responded with two birds yes those are birds I know because in a bird biology guy and there are only two not three so not only does sun not know what a tree is she also can't count and that's just terrible.

It only takes 3 trees to block you in/out.
or if you lose really bad you could just plant trees to make a wall in front of the fountain.
And by tangos I mean branches but w/e.
New level of disrespect.
Guys, imagine at the end of a game selling all your items in the enemy fountain and then buying a bunch of tangos and planting a forest in their base.
^ yeah that.
Anfy had the good idea of eating a tree, running in to the spot where you ate the tree then plant a tree to hide.
i'm talking you go to the tree line already and plant the tree in a spot where you entered.
Jon you'd need like four trees to hide in.

i think the new cd for hook with aghs is 4 seconds.
you can hook, ult, and then basically hook again.
That's like a 500-550dmg hook every what? 6 secs.
Also the spell range item increases dmg by 8%.
Well yea new range item, his ult is pretty much aghs upgraded already and new aghs increases damage of hook plus lowers cool down.
according to waga pudge is insane.

I think a Necro arcana could be cool.

the new meta is I need to get my butt on dota.
next they need is a pugnarcana.
yup, gonna buy that zeus arcana.
go arcane boots early and then disassemble into it.
mana.
regen.
magic resistence.
longer cast range.
it gives him everthing he needs.
aether lense on him is gonna be sweet though.
you already did that.
The new meta is going to be pudge. I won't play anything else .
not entirely sure on the numbers though.
still a buff, but i think that stuff is about the same as it was if you leveled synergy.
i think most of those were to makeup for getting rid of synergy though.
I can't wait to see the new meta with this patch.
Yea that and his movement speed and bear attack are a lot more powerful passively.
cant be ganked as easily.
or mid i guess.
makes him much more viable in the offlane i think because he can use it defensively.
Run! Peasants!
I played with Lone Druid too, new ability is cool.
unnerfs it from 2 patches ago.
As if you already couldn't.
But you can Laguna from across the map now.
Just spells I think.
would that work for euls or only spells?
Dude is sick.
I played around with arc warden yesterday too.
the cast range improvement is pretty sweet.
Lina is going to be insane now too.
Further increasing spell caster carries.
Holy shit 6.86 looks legit.
like the PA dagger things.
yeah that emblem thing is cool.
The blink effect is sweet. Also the roar and emblem during ult.
that shit looks so cool.

"where you going scrub?".

>surgeable.
it really sucked before going against a pl who knew what he was doing.
surge was already purgeable, diffusal now hard counters ds.
hard countered.
lol.
doesn't matter, oracle can purge your shell now. you're always shut down.
instead of having to run all the way to the jungle, i can just farm the nearby camp.
but for real i'm thinking about those games i get shut down as a ds or a centaur in lane.
gg ez.
toss into call.
not a bad combo anyways lol.
so axe can tank the creepwave.
tiny axe.
offlane tiny meta. no lanes ever meet.
and if he's in lane getting full exp then fuck it who cares.
if the lane is pushing he's in lane.
if he's farming the stack its because the lane is pulled.
20% longer if you get a centaur.
it takes a bit longer.
if you're du-du-du-du-du'ing your tower is gonna go down.
he just sits there.
who cares if they take less damage.
offlane sk? farm the secret shop camp?
stacks that got nerfed.
and he's a hero who can farm it fast with stacks.
yeah, i think aghs sk becomes extremely good at ganking in the midgame.
when jon visits cities he stays at a Hamada Inn.
>Hamada.
Damage.
In a creep wave that's a few Hundred Hamada.
i think im just gonna have to let jesus take the wheel on this meta. i don't have a friggin clue.
But adding the loosen to target would be more damage now. That's the huge part.
but now it makes burrowstrike insane.
it did, but some people would still go aghs.
i thought veil did more damage in every situation than aghs?
I feel like it is.
its not a bad item on him, and the stats are super nice.
mike, idk if its a must buy, but aghs was already considered on sk.
lol, woody self like.
dual offlane meta? tiny support + 1.
^if they are getting shut down in lane.
Puck still not good .
b) is huge for heroes like DS and axe who can stack and farm those camps.
the offlane camp change a) allows certain heroes to pull the dire offlane to the secret shop camp.
the range is dope but you think it's a must-buy?
obviously he will eventually want to go both.
sk now has aghs as an alternative to going blink first given how huge that range is.
Pudge is definitely stronger now. even without an aghs he gets the lifesteal from dismember which i feel like is big.
jon I love that card.
I agree with stu that batrider is viable again.

its a ... rot of damage.
I've been talking since minute 1 that pudge is top tier now. And you didn't count the rot damage.
is octarine even worth it at that point?
Woody hits every hook.
pudge meta.
@Woody  better get ready to hit some hooks bro.
so if you can hook + dismember + hook it's ~~ 1500+ dmg.
also, the 3 sec CD means that hook will be off cd after dismember has ended.
Pudge with Aghs + Lens + Octarine Core:
513 pure damage hook on 3 sec CD with 1500 range.

i wonder if it will make dual mids more common in pro games -- the lane is less safe. I'm curious what will become of those two neutral camps near the ancients. who farms those?
I'm actually good with it. Ganks on radiant mid were always so much harder.
I didn't realize how much the radiant tower moved in mid lane.
It's OK Ryan gosling.

300 dmg / person, basically an echo when he has aghs.
the imprison means that everyone who comes down damages everyone if they're close enough.
other range item for hitting from a real ranged distance.
range item for longer imprisons.
other thought: OD wins.
Sunder requires you to be standing on top of the enemy.
New thought: the improved cast range item is a huge buff to terrorblade.
i guess you can help more in teamfights but i miss the health regen.
rikis new ult does not feel good.
That's bullshit. Imagine running away from that. Id just try and smoke and run away since its so far away.

#oracle some people don't have maps.
i keep telling you riki shadowblade doesnt work.
Shadow blade first item.
did you get your bfury.
Got shit on in pick up. Couldn't carry. 
#gif who is this 4chan.
The milk, b. 
Cookie crisp is second rate booty.
i'm afraid as i get older i'm forgetting why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch.
CTC is the cat's meow.
#oracle what makes android so unique.
#oracle how would you describe the perfect iPhone.
im not sure why but you could do it.
but you could stack your iphones like books.
That is a shitty concept .
#gif crack is cool.
#gif crack is wack.
I don't smoke drugs, I mostly just inject the heroin between my toes.
Then follow "I don't smoke drugs, I smoke clowns like you on the b ball court".
Lure them into asking you if you want drugs.
Playing with new people in pick up. Always intimidating.
me too sun.
#oracle pugna roolz.
dota rules.
I dunno. Hockey stuff.
Maybe if the walrus punch assisted to an axe dunk they'd do a one-timer line as well.
Cool interaction with shaker wall. He'd drop a stone wall goalie line.
Walrus punch then dies two hits later for an assist icefrog pls.
Records kills. Three walrus punch kills is a hat trick.
Omg RCMP tusk .
skates.
Walrus punch plays a hockey goal horn.
gg ez.
hockey stick.
give him a hockey helmet.
It says "HE SHOOTS HE SCORES" instead of WALRUS PUNCH now.
THAT WOULD BE SICK.
Shards are hockey goal.
he already throws out an igloo.
Sigil is now Canadian flag.
Tusk.
Need an arcanada for risk.
okay.
am i gonna buy the zeus arcanada #?
It banks matt for the correction.
>what hell.
>easy hanks.
Needs two levels to deal int, and can't sustain the mana. Bigger change is the 4s prison. Easy hanks .
pugna, clinkz, and warlock all were quietly buffed.
Also I feel like OD is strong now. Stealing int with arcane orb?
>gotem.
more like 15 assists.
I was clock. I probably had fifteen kills when you got radiance. 
you remember.
you were there.
the moment i got that radiance I got an ultra kill.
I like the new sacred arrow too.
"i...won" is exceedingly misleading matt.
gg ez.
give him that +130 attack range.
eziest last hits of his life.
7 damage!
and i still won that game with a 40 min radiance so w/e.
What about that jakiro buff tho.
Yawn gg ez.
you're not allowed to comment.
and jon you dont play dota.
i dont play alch.
So you're saying you'd farm a 40 min radiance with alc matt.
Also quadruple heart cent does moar damage .
Ah I can see it.
Hard doubt it.
Bat rider is coming back with that hp regen.
Way less easily now.
but still if you know how to farm well he's still going to have a 15 minute radiance.
yeah gets rid of an insta bottle.
Well what grevil does is makes alc crazy early. It at least limits that .
Alch can't get bottle as easily at lvl 1 and can't farm as easily from runes early.
Runes are so unreliable that you'll be ideally getting 1-2 levels between each rune.
Also with all these new aghs it makes alch more relevant.
I don't know if the grevil's nerf will do that much.
Also Riki is inching closer to free pathing.
The grevils nerf might make alc less played.
Stu you've been gone too long. Alch rarely gifts.
I'd like to see an interesting 4 alch.
bristle offlane is pretty versatile so I can see it being picked up there.
it makes bristle an interesting counter to Weave.
I agree ham.
I don't think aghs will be core on any of the new people.
#gif i remember my first beer.
like you'd realistically get it after blink force staff.
#gif my first beer.
but the thing is aghs will never be core on Magnus so if you can afford one the game should already be over.
yeah it'll be interesting to see how people use it.
#gif whoo whoo.
Also bristle what whaaaat.
Drow benefits well from the stats.
I think the Drow and Magnus aghs are the best imo.
That's a lot of damage if you're fed .
Me too.
I think the drow aghs is neat.
Matt are you dead.
I can usually tell when leveling that up, so +130 distance would be kinda cool.
Take Aims (snipers passive distances at lvl 1-4: BONUS RANGE: 100 / 200 / 300 / 400.
My phone knows aghs as a word.
I think that's basically ench aghs.
I would have to see what +130 attack range looked like .
Sniper from halfway across the map lol.
The Dragon Lance item might be interesting. Maybe drow could benefit from the added range. Sniper might be even more annoying.
Aghs on SK would be fun as shit. Just burrowstriking fuckers from downtown .
Empower is an aura around him? I think?
I don't understand how that one works. 
I dunno how viable any of the new aghs are. Maybe magnus if you have two right clickers.
Who wins.
Dp razor mid fight go.
which is more like razor.
i guess she can move with it on.
yeah.
razor's link steals attack right.
it steals health.
it seems more like pugna to me.
Venge wk Abby overthrow incoming.
New DP move seems like Razor static link .
The venge aghs is hilarious. Sounds like you might never stop playing the game.
*enigma.
andy go do your teset.
also matt's house may have burned down while we were on skype. unsure.
FV riki new wombo combo.
i dont know whats going on anymore.
We decided it was the opposite of Jug ult. Better with more people around.
i dont fkkin know.
wtf is this new riki ult.
Pudge the new best hero.
cheaper support items.
Puck buff to small. Pudge buffs top tier.
but supports in general got buffed.
ruby small buff.
Omni no change cause he's already OP.
it's v good.
Venge aghs new ability.
And my bottom bitch Venge.
hows my dude Rubick and Omni doing.
PA got nerfed even further so it's okay jan.
BOB ROSS META.
I. Picked. A horrible time. To quit dota.
OMG.
>Using Tango on Iron Branch trees provides double healing duration.
OMG YOU CAN PLANT IRON BRANCHES.
but you're too far.
yee boi.
mike you still on skype?
my christ.
huge buffs to bottle.
holy fuck that's amazin.
no long can spamfeed couriers.
THANK YOU MR LIZARD.
Courier purchase cooldown increased from 7 seconds to 2 minutes.
abyssal blade damage doubled.
jesus christ.
http://i.imgur.com/5A7pO8X.gifv.
also in probably like 2 patchs we'll be at a point where every hero has an aghs upgrade.
i dont totally understand new riki yet but i feel like it's going to ruin people.
WR nerfed in to oblivion.
skipped map changes because i need a goddang map to look at.
im all over the place here.
holy christ that's good.
and magnus aghs.
big pudge buffs too.
matt what the fuck order are you reading lol.
DK out of  control good now.
John Cena changed name to DAAH DAAHT DOOT DAAH.
and I can't believe zet is in the game now.
also they buffed Warlock hard.
how do WK's aghs and Venge's aghs interact?
explain this to me.
okay.
@(>' ')>   <(' '<) looks a lot like him .
andy get on skype and nerd with me.
offlane FV is the only way to play him now yeeee.
@John Cena .
LOL WHAT THE SHIT FV.
Is that Joel? 
#gif pie.
what the shit is fv's new move.
>3.14 delay time.
Dick butt buff extended hook reach 33%. Sucks that his aghs was nerfed to pre-flago levels.
maybe.
idk.
because it doesnt apply damage until it hits.
3.14 delay time is no easy task tho.
you can keep them in place with reapers.
exactly my first though, but idk.
that actually sounds viable?
find a way to line up earth splitter + reaper's scythe == instagib.
one of the best scaling nukes in the game now if you can land it.
yeah, 50% is no joke.
holy shit elder titan.
aghs now core item.
lol also he got mega nerfed.
@Woody  you got buffed.
ES in captains mode!
we're meta now boys.
he needs slow attack.
wow look at Drow aghs.
with alpha wolf creep he'll have a bash and a crit.
yeah, because they gave him a bash.
Dragon Blood HP regen increased from 2/3/4/5 to 3/6/9/12 DK META INCOMING.
Also all the nerdy gibberish is kinda funny .
holy god doom's BAT is 2.0.
Do you .
sorry for all this @(>' ')>   <(' '<)  @John Cena .
i guess shes is like basically a new hero.
dude, the teaser pic was heroes they removed from cm.
ok wtf DP == new razor.
went pretty well actuallt.
i tried maxing it recently.
they want peopel to level that skill.
lol FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST SKILL ME PLS.
Poison Touch mana cost reduced from 100 to 70.
but idk, we'll see.
so you can tell people to enter the octagon.
just in a circle.
i think you get 8 cogs around you.
do i get an infinite number of infinitely small cogs.
i dont get it.
wtf at the clock change.
i agree, i think he's actually good now.
CK meta incoming boyssss.
Reality Rift bonus damage increased from 60/80/100/120 to 60/100/140/180.
lol @ bristle aghs.
be still my heart im not there.
its pretty funny.
minor clock change mike.
biggest takeaway is nerfing radiant roshan approaches and apparently removing cliffing options.
i didnt read those because instead i'm gonna wait for someone to post a goddamn map.
im still in the friggin terrain changes jeez.
bristle aghs added, lol.
mostly sf i'd think but yeah all of them.
yeah the magic resist thing is gonna be big for a lot of mids that rely on it (sf, lina, qop, tiny).
chen buffs.
wow stacking nerfed.
not lame.
>Added Random Draft to Ranked Matchmaking.
lame.
>Random Draft hero pool increased from 24 to 50.
bristle rampage.
safelane buffed.
i cant even imagine the interactions.
wow get the arcane rune + octarine and jesus christ.
new creep camps near the secret shops.
holy shit. one increases attack range, and another increases spell casting range.
give me 5 to read then anyone want to skype to discuss.
new items.
new rune that reduces cds and mana cost.
holy shit the new zeus looks badass.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Oh yes.

#gif pooping .
Mild annoyance.
I don't mind stink bugs even a little bit.
that said, i'm going to listen to that song on repeat for another 15 minutes.
now that i listened to it, i did not like that live recording as much as the album version, matt. there was a weird flanger/delay in the first part of the song and her voice doesn't sound as strong.
They get everywhere and never die and fly right into your face because fuck you is why.
Goddamnit I hate those things. If there were a most painful way for bugs to die I'd inflict it on stink bugs.
"Son, I took an oath".
"Fuck you son. Papas gotta take a shit".
"Dad, no! Not in the church!".
I'd take a shit in there if there was a bug or not.
What if you find one on the aisle of your first child's communion in a church.
You're right. Every time I find a stink bug now, I'm gonna take a shit on it.
Fuck stink bugs. Probably still didn't even die. 
There was a stink bug in my toilet. I flushed it. Then I took a poop in said toilet. Couldn't help but think how awful that bugs final moments were.
I like that song.

I'd think NFL would have more long term head injuries because you're getting hit now often.
sike nah I didn't say that. 
Basically its not a sport to watch if you're gonna be a huge vagina about it the whole time. 
The refs are really good about stopping the fights when things get bad though, which is why yesterday the fight only lasted 11 seconds.
Like last night for the middleweight championship, the fight went to KO in the third but afterwards the interview with both guys was basically incoherent .
Ok so. Rarely do fights not go at least two - three rounds. Ronnie is right, so basically after fights Joe Rogan interviews the fighters and they do a play by play analysis you can easily tell the head trauma everytime.
I dunno. The prime fighters seem to know how much damage each fight does to them so they fight so rarely. NFL players are all so fucked up cause they get his every play.
I sure didn't .
who knew?
turns out repeated blows to the head is bad for your brain.
I would think not much since the sport is based around punching the other guy in the face as hard as possible .
I wonder if there will be the same kind of backlash that the NHL and NFL are facing with brain injuries in UFC.
Brain damage stats are gonna be unreal in like 10 years .
also, going back to what ronnie said, I think it's inevitable that someone is going to die at one of these major UFC events. People are just getting stronger and faster and the fights are getting more brutal that it seems like it's bound to happen.

I've also always wondered how much brain damage is being done when the KO'd guy gets punched in the face a few more times before the fight is stopped. Seems like an ez way to kill a guy .
Jon is probably asleep but bring this back up later.
I find it mind-numbingly stupid.
Biggest fight in UFC history lasts two seconds. Has every fight before that only lasted one second?
I -really- don't get UFC. Every fight gets built up so much with the analysis and promotion and weigh ins and all that crap, but every "fight" lasts like under a minute. You can barely call most of them fights because its normally just one or two punches and that's it.

Searing. Fo sho.
Cook slower*.
Outside moist? No no. Skin doesn't get crispy via liquid. It regulates the cooking (putting liquid on something makes it cool slower) so people are less likely to overcook and THAT makes good moist.
Woody. What are your thoughts on searing?
Keeps the outside moist.
It doesn't "make meat moist". Surface liquid doesn't magically diffuse into the meat.
Basting.
Yes.

It's flip cup but if your team loses, your team has a "flip off" internally. Whoever loses is kicked off the team. You still have to cover the cup though so people start doing doubles and triples.

#oracle DuPont Dow merger .
Yeah with the growth of the firm, they won't have much of a choice but to spin off certain products. They were already spread somewhat thin with just Dupont's portfolio. 
DuPont isn't as big in DE as it used to be, but this is still gonna have a huge effect .
I think they're gonna merge and then breakup the major departments. That's what the activist investor Nelson Peltz has been trying to do to DuPont and mostly why Ellen kullman was kinda forced out .
This may have big ramifications for Delaware as a whole as they may try to consolidate functions. Will be interesting to see what happens as this goes through. It was already a wild year for Dupont, but this is crazy.
> "Now that the two companies' boards of directors have agreed to terms, their shareholders will also need to affirm the merger. Terms of the agreement state that Dow shareholders will get 1 share of the new enterprise for each Dow share they own, while DuPont shareholders will get 1.28 shares. They will own about 50 percent of the new enterprise.".

Also, this merger is fuggin awesome bc my mom's only ties to DuPont at this point are her stock options .
I was thinking about this the other day. Isn't it crazy that we went to school the (now former) CEO of  DuPont?
i should be a 'naming things' consultant. dowdupont sounds stupid.
> "The two largest chemical companies in America will become one entity named DowDuPont, as Dow Chemical and DuPont say they're joining in a "merger of equals." The new company will have a market capitalization of around $130 billion.".

its easier to get weed than a gun in DC.
Cause guns are legal and weed isn't? Next question.
"Is it easier to buy guns than weed?"

"Probably yeah"

"Why".
This iceiceice interview is nuts.
My man moar drinks.
#kobe.

is there an appropriate amount of work drunk in the app world.
Too drunk 4 work.
>smoke weed.
"this is your third trip to play at the summit. anything you're looking to do here?".
anyone watching the iceiceice interview.
"he escaped like shawshank redemption and outplayed the warden".
savage.
omg the Ritsu burn.
#gif wot m8.
TC backpacking hard.
lol.
im supervising an exam and trying not to laugh.
this cast is hilarious.
he's one of the few players on a chinese team who speaks some english.
i'm sure he will at some point.
would love to see him cast a game.
he's hilarious.
yeah he's creeping.
HA! did you see iceiceice sneak out of the frame in the back?
also ww can fly out of cogs, right?
true.
except PL.
clock is good against all of their heroes.
i gotta root for team canada.
I'm nervous for EG.
how stoked/10 are you Mike?
Bulba Clockwork.
Yeah there's always got to be someone for the energy and then someone for the intellect.
and OD pixel doesnt have good analysis, but he's great at moving the conversation along and asking good questions to the pros.
yeah you can always see them eating in the kitchen.
And I love how everyone is just hanging out in the background.
Winter is really good too.
sure ODPixel rapgod but having the pros cast just gives so much more insight in to the game.
this is probably my favorite tourny after TI.
I love the pro casts.
he is, very analytical.
Notail is a great caster.
and the bear strat was unexpected and pretty cool.
haha, yeah TC on DC is apparently canadian.
I am loving all the shout outs to Canada in this game.
qhy.
phaseboots lich.
omg a fuckin teamwipe.
Bear with alacrity and shield is nasty.
wat.
what.
eg running core abby, invoker, and lone druid.
maybe try to fill it with a bunch of dragos but one can only mask the pain so much.
i dont know how you could expect to emotionally deal with a lack of jon for 21 days.
#rekt.
Next year is like 3 weeks, I'll be fine without Jon for 3 weeks.
gl hf with your pictures and websites.
bye jan it's been fun looking forward to playing with you again next year.
*masturbation*.
Uninstalling tonight.

Efforts and time will be going elsewhere. 
And Jon made pudge plays last night for Overthrow.
im taking a break from dota again. 
so is brian.
Woody you are a good pudge.
i'll do a laugh.
do a submission.
fails of the week.
it was magic.
and tinker just walked away.
I need to start capturing gifs from games. In that game 3 of us were chasing tinker. Slark jumped in, I hooked him back, then QoP silenced a creep.
also do I ever miss #last.
> no.
>read.
> things which jon will never do.
>things im going to do the next time woody misses a hook.
gg noob pudge, report.
all it takes is a few teammate pings and you miss all the hooks.
also positive reinforcement.
Pudge is more heart of the cards.
except when throwing hooks. can't be thinking then. that's intuition and heart.
clockwerk is a thinking man's hero. an elegant weapon, for a more civilized age.
but also damages yourself...
Rot wins.
gonna math lvl 1 battery assault vs rot assuming 2 creeps.
Hook battles .
Ok.
1v1 me brah.
I am the one who hooks.
and its meaty.
There can only be one true hook.
Bullshit.

@Andy Esposito  is that how the law works.
#oracle work today was super friggin tedious.
I would agree.
#oracle tiny folk.
she'd probably wander off to narnia in a king size bed.
your woman is tiny.
also Nurses. Nice.
Tiny beds, gotta keep em close.
liz has one and her starfishing doesn't even bother me when i stay over.
king size beds rule.
that was my takeaway from that gif.
that's a pretty wide bed.
no one ever does.
#oracle its okay if its in a three way.
#gif hello nurse.

Now all we need is Andy's drawing.
Original concept.
That's the only free one though. 
Let me know if you want more samples.
Attached is a sample that I think would work really well. 
Or something really similar.
Would it be illegal for me to use this: �.
Take a picture of someone else's logo.
Good ideas.
Gotta work on my logo this weekend then.
Well not scummy. It's true, so why not.
Step 2: Business Cards.
just somewhere use the word "freelancing" so you have plausible deniability.
Seems kinda scummy though. I'll figure out something.
That's exactly what i was gonna do lol.
Jon fake it till you make it. Tell them you are working with Brain Farm and you were hoping to get some pre/post shots.
Or nothing.
Worst they could say is fuck you.
I might contact the snowboarders and skiiers competing in that event I'm covering now.
<3 using branches.
It's really hard to test. 
There is a branch with an alternate version but it didn't seem to be working super well.
Woody do a fix on oracle.
So you succeeded .
Well it is super funny.
it thinks they're super important.
which is why Names come up so often.
But that isn't how sUN works. It works the wrong way.
And i was like, woody found that out.
She mentioned the idea that less used words are more important.
Talking about information retrieval in bioinformatics and the frequency of words. Thought about woody and oracle .

We should play Civ again...
There is only one winner in Civ and my archers were there to make sure it was me.
That city had it all. Coast, a variety of luxury resources, booming economy, but little in self defense which woody exploited.
I still remember when woody took Bird R Tite from me.
At least my city names were 'matt sucks'.
Nice civilisation you caveman.
Lol mike got rekt by barbarians.
Also I wish I hadn't died alone.
I wish multiplayer civ online hadnt been so slow and buggy.
Now DnD over Skype I would do.
No you don't.
I didn't do it. Also won't do it. Have standards.
I'd totally do it again.
dota fantasy was the tits.
Also Andy's draft thing wouldn't work and he had to auto draft his whole team and he was the only one who did any kind of research in to who he'd like to draft.
Remember when we did a dota fantasy draft and we were all on Skype and halfway through the draft the was some silence and I forgot who asked "So... This is the nerdiest thing we've all ever done, right?" And we all agreed.
#oracle are you still there?
Wtf was that response.
Nerdiest response 2k15.
You broke oracle.
#oracle maw fuggin slaw.
I hate it when people call a group of people gathering to grill BBQ. Makes me things there is going to be pulled pork, ribs, and some mothah fuggin slaw. Then there's just burgers and dogs.
Now I want BBQ.
BBQ is delicious.
That BBQ probably exceeded expectations. 
I'm gonna buy tickets to this event Jon is taking photos of and photobomb them all.
Me neither woofy.
And now I'm sad.
I wasn't there for that.
A lot if weird things have happened in samir's basement. 
HAHAHA omg I forgot about that shit. Too funny. 
LOL ok, second happiest i've ever been.
how about that one time we got katie seabrook and alexis to make out?
Could be the happiest I've ever been.
I am very happy right now.

seems like jon is taking the news really well or really poorly.
Big moment I just had.
Contacted one of my best friends who works for a company out in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Company is called Brain Farm and they do some dope work. But he let his boss know my idea of going to shoot this and he liked the event. So he's asking me to go there on behalf of their company to shoot for their website.

Dearest Woody,
You have been cordially invited to take place in a most gay affair. Our group has commenced the telling of puns, the subject of which relates to cameras. We do hope that you will consider joining us on this joyous occasion.
Yours Truly,

It is my resolution to keep my focus during this event.
In conclusion, I hope you'll pixel me to come.
don't forget to bring the selfie stick.

jon do all this then show up with your iphone to take pictures.
I'm late to the party.
Sty see above.
I've been developing my skills for several years now.
I'm happy to lens a hand wherever I'm needed.
I have nokia what I'm doing, but please let me take the pictures anyway.
I can even fiddle with two f-stops at once.
I've fiddled with lots of f-stops before.
jon are you writing these down.
I've never had a negative review.
I'm no apature, I have lots of experience.
My skills are really developing.
i hope you won't snap to judgement when i say you'll shutter at the quality of my work.
"It'll be great exposure for me".
"I know this request isn't completely Canon, but I think you'll Leica what you see".
oh just make photography company puns.
Film.

Cutting edge.

jon be sure to incorporate the phrases "innovator" "paradigm" and "raw, unbridled sexual fury".
pretty similar to the reviews i've received from women.
"this website is good as long as you don't have to look at it".
This e-mail i'm gonna write to polartec has gotta be good. It's gotta be the 2001 space odyssey of e-mails.
There's definitely a place for this, but absolutely not right now lol.
Thanks mike.
liz read them to me on a car ride once and they were hilarious.
There, now it's out of my view.

#oracle thants.
I'm gonna be writing up an email later today andy. If you wanna go tag team and review my case .
And its basically just cause i wanna do it lol.
Ive got my website up and running but im not affiliated with anyone other than myself .
i can't believe I'm saying this, but it would actually help if you had a blog.
Its for this really sick big air event for snowboarders and skiiers on the field for fenway and ive been emailing fenway and the sponsor everyday.
So ive been on the hunt lately to try and get a photographer pass for this event in Fenway Park in february.
ez.
start a corperation, register her car as a company vehicle.
of course you can, pay attention.
Level*.
So I can't track my wife? Why did we get married then? I assume I had some peel of ownership.
#oracle scrandy.
mike has definitely used that word before.
#oracle thandy.
Thanks Andy �.
it probably cant be used in criminal trials, but in civil ones it might be able to.
With a cute little basket on the handlebars.
So in the case of licensed private eye, how can that information be used in legal proceedings. 
If you have a paper route.
How about a bicycle?
it just has to be for business purposes.
also according to the statute 1 vehicle can be a fleet.
Fleet of cars. 
Mike's dad can track whoever the hell he wants. 
also if you own a "fleet of vehicles" you can track the vehicles.
so is tracking your kids.
private investigators who are licensed are an exception.
^law in virginia.
Any person who installs or places an electronic tracking device through intentionally deceptive means and without consent, or causes an electronic tracking device to be installed or placed through intentionally deceptive means and without consent, and uses such device to track the location of any person is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.
found it.
so I've learned that the fact that the search term "track" sucks ass because it means like 8 different things.
#oracle do legally ambiguous things to me.
I have no idea if thats legal in the U.S. but give me a sec to do law searchy things.
Yay Andy is here. Help plzzzzz.
Cool.
My mom owns the house, my dad owns the cars.
You don't have to do it that way.
I learned that if Erika and I buy a house neither of us owns it. Our marriage owns the house.
@Andy Esposito  pls.
Since both situations.
Since situations are non consensual in a way.
I guess it isn't? I guess I'm interested in the ramifications of the fallout from the divorce. Are either testimonies, tracker or private eye, usable to void prenups or other asset agreements. 
I have no idea how the legal proceedings of divorces work, but if people use private eyes to spy on their spouses how would this be any different?
The only thing that could interfere is that the data could be dismissed as non consensual 'tracking'. You have to establish that the person  was using the device solely to track the car, and that the situation is circumstantial. Or not? I don't know. 
>People are idiots, more news at 11.
these tags are essentially harmless but they've been marketed as a tool to catch your cheating spouse.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction.
Could maybe use it to set up parallel construction.
I wonder if you could use the supporting data in a divorce case to avoid asset split. 
http://www.gpsfortoday.com/tag/i-gotu/.
yeah exactly.
Maybe under the guise that you are tracking your car in the event it's stolen, but really tracking that lying bitch.
*and.
they're really small are super user friendly.
http://global.mobileaction.com/product/product_i-gotU.jsp.
How is that legal... @Andy Esposito plz.
it's a map of my study species (duck) movements through the winter.
people who suspect that their significant other may be unfaithful are buying them and hiding them in their cars / purses to track their movements.
these satellite tags that we've been putting on birds have been modified and are now being sold as "I Got U" tags which can be purchased to track people now.
What is it? 
Lol I appreciate the Canada call out.

#highschool.
Doolittle - Pixies 
Let It Die - Feist
Old World Underground Where Are You Now? - Metric.
That and a Sugar Ray and Beastie Boys album from my brother.
Yeah I dunno where that came from. But I liked wu and tribe after stealing mix CDs from my older brother and sister. Then i was like, yo what is this.
Tower hill is a breeding ground for rap fans .
Funeral by Arcade Fire and You Forgot It In People by Broken Social Scene are right up there too.
Good Kid Maad City is up there for me, same with Enter the 36 Chambers.
You guys are big on the rap n roll.
Enter the 36 chambers - wutang
Only built 4 Cuban lynx - raekwon.
Ready to Die by Biggie for me .
A few albums I like from start to finish:
Illmatic - Nas
Food and liquor - Lupe
Midnight marauders + Low end theory - atcq
Chronic 2001 - Dr Dre 
Mbdtf - kanye.
Those are albums I like from start to finish with no intention to skip a song. 
Bookends by Simon and Garfunkel .
Lonerism by Tame Impala .
I like..Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix by Phoenix, self titled Vampire Weekend, United by Phoenix, Good Kid Maad city by Kendrick .
#3: Mac Miller #4: Kanye #5: j Cole.

what are peoples' favourite albums here? (tough question I know).
looking it up, it got pretty middling reviews.
it's flawless.
that album is just so unimpeachably good.
After watching that movie enough I think superheroes is one of my favourites. The build in the intro gives me goosebumps still .
I used to always have Discovery in the background while I'd play Civ 3 so it always reminds me of the game when I hear the music.
Voyager is the best.
last fun fact: "something about us" is sex in song form.

Planning on taking june to travel through the states a bit, do bonnaroo again if the lineup is good and take in some heat before vanishing to the arctic again.
If you guys go in June I might be in the area.

Okey doke, good idea. Once I get more info and stuff we'll make a thread of some sort.
woody: nawlins, eric: key west.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.
Which is the key.
This trip will happen because one person is willing to do all the work.
or a separate chat specific 2 that.
can make email thred and update there if that's appealing.
I'm gonna keep doing more and more research and look at reviews at lodging etc. also on other activities. I'll keep updating this random note I'm writing and send it to whomever is interested.
a changeup would be nice.
i feel like every trip i've done in the last ~ever has been for pure miscreancy.
They are more than welcome to come Woody. IMO, the more the merrier.

yeah jon.
Are women coming on this trip?
Also that flight information was very loose. I just punched in a date and my airport to get a general idea.
still writing up more stuff i'm learning, but the intention is to hike the trails that are open and maybe do a couple other sweet things.
Springtime in Glacier seems to be the middle of May to the end of June
Things to see in the Spring:

	* Glacier lilies, trillium, balsam root
	* Waterfalls running at their fullest
	* Animals are emerging
	* Less crowds


End of June seems like a perfect time to go, as most businesses will be reopening from the winter and things are up and going
Lodging here is a good start: http://www.glacierguides.com/za/GG?PAGE=THE_LODGE&CAT=CHALET

Using the Hopper app for Android: Estimate for Jun 17 - June 23 (Now roundtrip: $567)

	* Price estimates could drop as low as $418 from today until April 10




Summertime in Glacier is July and August
Things to see in the Summer:

	* Most trails are open
	* Flowers are in full bloom (flowers are usually at their full around second week of July)
	* Lots of activities (means more tourists)




Autumn in Glacier is September to November
Things to note:

	* Much more secluded
	* Weather is more adverse.
Maybe throw some dice.
jon doesn't drink you fool.
Ok here, i'll send what i've been writing up the past few minutes.
I'm guessing alcohol.

36 per cent by age 85.!

>Even
if we considered all accidents combined, the corresponding
risks are 1.5 per cent by age 65 and 2.4 per cent by age 85. This
is in contrast with the risks for heavy smokers for dying of
smoking: 16 per cent by age 65 and 36 per cent by age 85.
honestly the entire point of that paper is "holy fucking shit smoking is risky and increases your chances of death dramatically but nobody knows it and everything thinks its not risky".
>Risk data should be presented to the public in a manner that clarifies these misconceptions and facilitates their understanding of the overwhelming risk imposed by smoking.

#oracle wat.
#gif wat.
wat.
because i think i just did it.
is it possible to shitpost on groupme.
But why do birds heads stay in the same place.
Jon it's pretty complicated but it mostly has to do on the fact that binary is the main sense computers have and computers have quite large accumulators relative to their CPU size. Mammals have smaller accumulators which have more transistor control which allows us to make very minuscule accumulator movements in order to keep our vision focused as our CPUs move. Computers dont have this capability, so if they want to focus their accumulation on something they need to keep their CPUs still in order to keep their processing focused.
alternatively,.
what Mike said.
wat... Thats the same.
some of the messages that come from groupme aren't messages as you think of them. some don't have message text bodies, so trying to access that key (m['text']) throws an error.

Good explanation matt.
like, if we're bouncing around in a car our eyes will constantly be making these small adjustments to keep our vision focus, a bird would need to keep its head totally stable to keep its vision focused.
Alright! That's the shit I wanted!
Jon it's pretty complicated but it mostly has to do on the fact that eyesight is the main sense birds have and birds have quite large eyes relative to their head size. Mammals have smaller eyes which have more muscular control which allows us to make very minuscule eye movements in order to keep our vision focused as our heads move. Birds dont have this capability, so if they want to focus their eyesight on something they need to keep their heads still in order to keep their vision focused.

Yeah the one stuff has been good too. Their elite controller with paddles in the back is sold out until spring 2016 on amazon. Underestimating demand for their peripherals. 
If the 360 headset is anything to go by, I guess the Microsoft stuff is decently durable .
Also #halolast.
I'll be honest that fifty dollars price point on the Xbox stereo headset is a good balance between price and quality you're gonna get. Their peripherals on the Xbox one stuff have been excellent so far. 
The headband looks like it'd break easily .
I've had good experience with turtle beach.
For a few extra bucks just get these. 
Yeah that'd be weird.
Seems like it's both audio and chat but in one ear. That would be disorienting.

Perhaps. Still seems kinda ridiculous to shell out so much money for a piece that only works in one set .
Nah dude the over the ears audio and chat is so nice. Don't have to worry about volume, neighbors, Chris. And you hear everything. The Xbox full audio and chat ones are actually supposed to be pretty good. 
Probably will end up with Xbox .
Fuck paying $50 for a headset.
Ah nvm. I feel like you're stuck getting the Xbox ones? I don't know the third party options for that.

It translates across generations though.

Interesting. 
Evidence is complicated though and basically always up to the discretion of the trial judge.
If you can lay a proper foundation and show relevance you can admit anything.
How the fuck are you supposed to do law things without these basic resources .
Depends on what the judge allows and whether the other side objects.
Do you print out a map and use pins? Or do they go togoogle maps?
What about showing a timeline of a crime?
You can present evidence and sometime people will use blown up pieces of evidence.
Definitely not power point. There's not a lot of presentations like that to the jury.
Do they use PowerPoint in the courtroom? Or do you still make posterboards.

Bentley would kill a duck before I could brag about owning a duck on GroupMe.
People are idiots. News at 11.
When in reality they're super hard to train and require tons of attention that dog pounds became overrun with Dalmatians because so few people wanted to put the time in to train them or just expected them to be these dream pets they saw in the movie.
It was like when the real life 101 Dalmatians movie came out. Everyone and their sister was going out to get Dalmatians because the movie made them out to be these dream pets.
If there's anybody's opinion about ducks as pets that I respect and believe, it's yours. I'm team Matt on this. 
Matt do you know why the caged bird sings.
In general I don't think birds should be pets.
The thing is, ducklings are super cute and desirable, adult ducks less so.
Most birds will think their mother is the first other animal they see that feeds and cares for them.
woody just needs to run ethernet to his computer upstairs.

It's your birthday. You can get whatever you want.

had I been with you I would've set a world record for the 100 yard dash if I had been told I need to pay 200 dollars to enter a strip club.
god the picture jon sent haunts my memories, and i wasn't even there.

thats real canadian money.
Learned a valuable lesson that day. When even the 'strippers' are confused, you're in the wrong place.

How would you switch between data though, and how would you know what source you're looking at?

blackhole: greater aoe, more damage, longer disable, easier to hit IMO. longer CD, huge mana cost, channeling spell so it can be cancelled if the other team is paying attention.

rp: smaller aoe, longer cast point so you can cancel it to fake out other team, less damage, less duration of a disable. shorter CD, no channeling so it's stun-and-done, clumps heroes on top of each other which is great in teamfights.

I couldn't grasp.
Ah, it was the clutch.
look, morty, you can't just put a science word in front of a car word.
But what uses up the carberator?
this is more intuitive in a manual. a ~~~~~~similar device exists in an automatic but it's called a torque converter.
Such a sensical answer. Wonderful.
the answer you're having issue with is the clutch. the clutch can 'slip' to allow the engine to still turn while not requiring the wheels to turn.
so the car is constantly generating torque.
remember that you have to have the brake on on a flat road even when you don't have any accelerator applied.
probably just a.
initial impression would be either a) the motor can still generate torque while not generating movement.
I feel I need some kind of mechanical diagram.
Where does the engine moving turn into keeping the tired from rolling back.
How can I keep my car stopped on an incline by pressing the gas?
This might be a dumb question so prepare.

therefore it must be right.
for example, since I started assuming that, the amount of arguments I won increased.
well correlation implies causation so I don't see the problem.
this paper isn't even about ducks (their first mistake), and the authors are really sloppy with their stats and formatting and they're presenting a lot of correlational results as facts.

#what percentage is water.
and then what proportion of that volume is composed of fat, protein, water, inorganic content, etc.
I imagine it functioning like the sassy code. X% probability of 'do you think woody/Mike is' call from list of self generated and decisively accurate compliments. Then finishing the rest of the Oracle command as usual. 
it's a joke, but also serious.
if you assume isometric growth (which is done a lot in biology) you pretty much calculate the volume of an organism as a modified sphere.
that's actually a pretty common method for calculating these body conditions.

Although lotus orb against lc is probably the worst one. Winner gets double damage.
You both charge each other, its hilarious.
I get Lotus orb for the lolz sometimes and there are never any lols :(.

Does lotus orb reflect spirit breakers charge. I saw a funny video one but didn't know if it actually worked.

A lot of early teamfight though, and grabbing a mek makes sense if no one else is buying. Might be a bit slow but still super helpful given how many right clickers are popular.

Stuns OP.
tranqs + SR and you can farm all day with W, Q fucks up lanes and fights, and the ult is outright stupid.
Try hard? Earthshaker.
Its one of those supports that lets you feel like you have a huge impact which is fun.
srsly tho.
WW OP.
WINter WINvern.
Its gonna be okay.
shoulda kept picking ww.
<3 moke.
im probably largely salty because i haven't won a game in 3 days.
If you dont have a jungler they'll gank mid instead.
I agree with woody. If their supports are that on the ball then you probably already lost.
great fun.
i do that alllllllllll the time with junglers.
but two supports smoking into the jungle? This isn't 5k, that never happens at my level.
hardly a counterpick.
counter picks gonna counter, thats true of any strategy.
gg 4v5 game andy abandons.
if they get a BH or a riki or god forbid are smart enough to smoke in and kill you.
if they don't, then obviously not.
I think its OK.
if the jungler comes out and makes an impact.
it all hinges on minute 8 to 14.
"i have a blink dagger" neat but everyone else is poor and their team is farmed.
and the rest of your team is underfarmed.
but then you lost your lanes for 6 minutes.
We had an invoker though. I like LC w/ Invoker for sunstrike.
But lc is not, he needs someone else to dish out damage.
Engima.
Or like bs.
Axe is a good hero for that.
I like when people jungle for a blink, get 6, and gank mid or a lane.
realized everyone else did bad too!
I focused, did bad.
Its never fun when you really focus on your lane, do decent, and then realize your team has died 10 times in the first 5 minutes.
eh screw jungling in general.
also.
i rarely wait in fountain. i either force staff into the woods or smoke to their jungle.
I was pretty focused on my thing.
it made 0 sense.
Tinker wanted to jungle?
Seconded.
And of all the people who play, I'm the one who never waits in the fountain for them to end. Never surrender.
We were going to lose (both LC and Tinker wanted to jungle so safelane went unfarmed for a while?) but I also did very poorly.
Rough game.

they basically said "Don't come here. Ever.".
Russia sent a helicopter to pickup the pilots. Turkey killed one of those guys too.
and then execute them in the woods.
"If [your pilots] forget where the borders are, we'll help them 'land.'".
thats harsh.
The pilots who parachuted out? They just gunned them down.

Nothing beats when we played that newer version of Doom (?) and we walked into the bathroom and then the game freaked out when we looked in the mirror.

She is studying at the women's health university searching for a cure for her sluttyness.

Now andy, you can't be sending half nude photos of chicks all willy nilly like.
what does that tattoo say?
Aggressive pantsless bumble pic.
thx ham.
And with that I am caught up on today. Keep it up everyone, you're doing great.

Then He asked, 'Do you eat rib-eye steaks and barbecued ribs?' 'I said, 'Not much... My former doctor said that all red meat is very unhealthy!'
'Do you spend a lot of time in the sun, like playing golf, boating, sailing, hiking, or bicycling?' 'No, I don't,' I said.
He asked, 'Do you gamble, drive motor-cycles, drive fast cars, or have a lot of sex?' 'No,' I said...

I might just fuck it and go 100% Fidelity.
Does anyone like their bank?
Any rate is better than what I got.
Also bonds have shit rates too.
I asked the BoA rep "How can I get a 1 year return on this money" and he pushed the savings account.
You should do an online savings like capital one 360 or ally. They hold minimal collateral, and loan out everything, which is why they can give you a higher rate.
Yeah but you don't have access to the money in bonds.
I've maybe made like $10 from my savings account ever.
Bonds have almost no risk and offer decent returns.
That isn't true.
No risk no reward.

Can't argue with Success.
-Wooday 2k15.
 At this point we starting debating the best way to "hook" it. Several attempts were made and we eventually settled on ramming it.

Mike y u so mean.
hundo pee cent.
that was definitely a slightly darker black suit.
did you have to choose between black and slightly darker black?
i made literally zero choices, and thats what I like when it comes to clothes.
I picked the tuxes for you...
What you did for my wedding was jack shit.
i had to decide between the slim fit pants and the regular pants. i dont remember what i chose but i chose right.
thats what we all did for your wedding woody. I doubt anything you did was more complicated.
It was slightly more complex than that.
"ooh, that one was real quick".
"Here's another quick mystery".
Wrong.
"How does this tux look, sir?"

"GREAT. I'll buy it now here cash no receipt please get me out of here can I get drunk now?".
I'm with andy on this show.
it's always five seconds with you've got mike with you.
No no, there would be challenges. 
walk into store, say yes, done.
it would take 5 seconds.
if the tux fucks.
"say 'fucks' to the tux".
maybe something more entertaining there.
We should make a "say yes to the Tux" show.
see if there are any other videos you can watch in liz's wedding folder.
*it's.
it so dumb.
everyone cries at the end.
eventually family memeber realizes who wedding is about.
"oh that's out of my budget" LOLOL buys it anyways.
her family member is skeptical.
she finds a dress she likes.
her family goes in with another.
she goes in with one idea.
every episode is literally exactly the same.
i did tell her to do that. no regrets / 10. that show is tolerable if you're shithoused though.
If you join my party, we're gonna play Dota. That's what you do.
yeah, and then you told her to put on say yes to the dress.
i did only watch your game because i got a text from liz bemoaning that her life had come to making jambalaya while andy was nude and playing doto.
i wish i had just dc'd.
woody qued without me realizing.
He skipped grocery store time so he's in the dog house.
and if you do, tell her she smells and should probably bathe.
dont tell her i said that.
do you think you can manage to dig your testicles out of Liz's purse later and stop watching Say Yes to the Dress?
currently watching say yes to the dress and trying to pull the knife out of my back.
i might be in, we'll see.
i would like to play some games later.
this should be obvious.
warlock is not a good solo support.
i randomed warlock first.
and jungling into a spec.... not a strong choice.
also solo supporting. get used to it andy.
jungle BS got nerfed. ancients drow though, thats new meta.
i could do nothing.
yeah it sucked.
spec got literally no farm in the beginning of the game, but somehow jungle bs didnt work.
i watched it happen... 3x?
andy how sad was it every time spec ulted and you died.

Who is the fifth member of the 'never die' lineup? I assume wk daz ww Abby....tusk? Offlane slark?

Yeah balling out of control. Funny to combine that with maybe dazzul and wyvern. Can keep you alive during the 45s ult downtime.
what is dead may never die.
My favorite WK build: blink, radiance, octarine then whatever.
Secret just won't give up on misery slardar.
nvm, he went blink.
i'm hoping.
Is he balling out if control?
so far, this build is basically exactly the one slasher does. if he goes refresher next it will be bascially exactly the same.
lol.
Did you see when they showed the stat of w33's gpm first game? 322.
also, is wk going slasher build?
yeah, i think secret is ahead. unless they throw i bet they have this game.
They're doing better thus far for this game.
This has been some high quality doto. I think secret needs to do better early game or ban these defensive supports.
These fights.
*game.

@Andy Esposito game two.
I've tried adding gifs to giffy with super specific tags to then find them but it hasn't worked.

Well I could see why there wasn't a gif out there for that level of specificity.

You heard it here first.
#oracle can you arrest a dog for theft.
That dog already steals hearts. Just like his daddy. 
also: when the enemy teams dazzel is higher net worth than your teams qop, you know you probably lost.
worst case scenario, you cant arrest a dog for theft.

Also OG OP .
Man I didn't know the streams were starting so early. Dang. I can't watch anything til the afternoon.
EG lost in the loser's bracket finals. Now i'm sad.
Erika might be the best wingman. She grabbed herself the white whale that is Woody. Pretty impressive. 
The other plus of YT music is that if you use Ifttt you can set up a recipe that can put stuff from YouTube you find into a playlist on Spotify. It doesn't always work though :/.
I'm also super indecisive so I also use Apple Music because their editor playlists are strong .
I'm still a Spotify guy too but I just love finding unusual things .
I'm still a big Spotify guy.
I have a sub to Google play music which gives you the whole shebang, as stu said. Downloading YouTube videos is nice. #teamstu.
Andy*.
True dat. Nice, thanks stu.
And google knows lots.
It's also nice because eventually it creates this offline playlist that constantly updates with stuff it thinks you'd like .
But it was awesome .
Example: I listened to a two hour studio ghibli piano mix during work today that I would never have thought to look for or find or listen to ever.
And the stuff I can find on it are things I can't find anywhere else.
Since I use YouTube for all sorts of things already, its recommendations and discovery are pretty great.
Might try it out .
What do you enjoy about it specifically .
If you use the app they give you a free trial of YouTube red though.
Yea it's weird because they have them separate .
Hm. Weird. Cause youtube is a google company. And google has the google music stuff.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/10/22/youtube-has-a-new-music-service-here-are-the-basics/.
oh wait.
maybe they should call it RedTube.
YT Red is the live streaming stuff.
They also released YT music.
Are you talking about the YouTube RED stuff? 
If it's not on Spotify it sure as hell is on YouTube .
On a related note has anyone used YouTube music yet? I'm really enjoying it.
You my boy blue...you my boy.
https://open.spotify.com/track/4HxukyGNRDjnZm3Q6jUDTT.
It's not true.
Actually I get no credit, Erika is staying on the prowl. She claims to be the best wingman .
She's not but I'm staying in the lookout  for Jon .
i bet she's just single now and wants the d.
That's what Jon does to women.
she went from 'hey nice photos' to 'i want to fuck jon' in no time.
going back a bit here. did that message about that girl wanting to bone jon seem pretty out of the blue to anyone else?

MS Paint skillz yo.
i didnt get my order changed because i remember joking about switching sides with steph. @erika pls.
All I remember is that there was a change from rehearsal order .
Wait. Andy is right but Ronnie is wrong? Agh to confusing.
Andy is right, Ronnie is right that I was right.
Ronnie is right, kim was with me during rehearsal and then eriKa decided to put her and jon together because she thought they'd hit it off. Clearly that was accurate.
@erika please clarify.
I thought we went in the chosen order for the rehearsal. Then we audibled to alphabetical order for the ceremony .
you chose the alphabet?
I may have told some purple otherwise but it was a lie.
We picked them.

Wasn't in the stars gents. 
But yeah, that girl was the best. Shoulda woulda .
I knew there was something to that. For that I am grateful. Wonderful friends. 
also wasn't the ordering for walking down the aisle strictly alphabetical?
"I would have fucked the shit out of [...] Jon" == fun.
That message kim sent was fun.
Must not be very good.
#oracle you got a catchphrase .
#gif just sayin.
This year's Beaujolais nouveau is out in your local store right now btw (wine). Only fermented a few weeks, it's light, with a berry taste, and great for drinking while reducing the cool downs for sUN.
wouldn't be woody if he didnt put out.
I've seen nudes here. I gotta do my part.
I got a gem like that? And you think I wasn't gonna put it out.
also 2.99 wine is a wine-ner.
also woody i appreciate the insight to share that here and not directly with jon.
also jon you "were" cool. sorry. we all peak sometime.
she should spell her name right.
>im using 4chan greentext arrows on groupme.
>has known her for the better part of a decade.
>best friends with her husband.
>went to her wedding.
>erica.
credit to erica for pairing the two for the walk down the aisle.
haha i liked your photos also i would have fucked your friend.
also damn son kim comes in hot.

You know, after watching the majors I was thinking I should learn to play tusk.

Also like 3 times their tusk saved me with shards when I shoulda died, so that was hilarious.

Step 2:.
i'm interested in step #2 of your plan, jon.
Go the other way. Buy a bunch of those weighted vests to make your commute harder. 
Walking op, Glyde Nerf commute pllzzz.
#oracle erika's car.
Or you both get those Glyde Segway things. EZ commute.
Get this and then make a bunch of dick jokes.
and reflects how smart she is?
less real talk: buy erika a smart car so the car looks proportionate to her.
Actually a good compromise between safety, price, and performance.
boob-aru.
real talk: join the subaru family. we know whats up.
"i'd like a car that is the wrong size in every conceivable way, and then also in some ways i never thought possible".
if you really hate erika, you should buy her a cadillac. the new ones fuckin suck.
would you really want to abandon something just because you have some small problems?
Get one of these.
i dont know, erika. sometimes it's worth holding onto something you care about, like a car or a relationship.
Commutes = we both walk.
I can really picture you guys in something like this .
What're your commutes like? Would this mostly be Erika's car?
Unless you're having kids within the next 3 yrs .
:( jon for janitor .
Volvo SUV? I feel like I can buy that when I'm 30 with kids.

Disagree. Volvo suv is the last thing you want now .
yay! Jon for president! 
If not that, I'm with jon.
I want a gas powered Tesla.

I won't. I did a bunch of research, can't get from Cville to DE on a single charge.
If truck is staying, then absolutely get some kind of yoloswag car .

Get a volvo SUV. Good MPG and incredibly safe. Also swags out so nice like.

and mat that is a healthy attitude towards visiting. whenever i go somewhere with my parents they're all "oh this and this and this and this and this" and then you're exhausted.
big pointy thing, where obama lives, then maybe a smithsonian?
I'll do a bit of research.
you have to do dc brunch if you come.
i will come up with some good food/drinking spots.
word. in that case pick out your top 2-3 things you wanna see.
I don't like cramming a bunch of things in to a trip when I travel because I find it exhausting and you don't really get to experience anything well if you're just bouncing from monument to monument or whatever. If I'm hanging out with you guys I'd just rather see a few things and then just eat some good food and drink some good beer and have some good conversations that aren't impeded by Andy's computer crashing and Jon's mic going to mosquito-mode.
matt come up with a list of things you want to see and we'll figure out how to see as many as possible.
"what should we store planes in? I don't know, a big ass hangar?".

Mike: book of mormon is great, you will love it. i saw it in DC.

the conference field trip is a duck hunt.
the musical.
matt do you know of avenue Q.
and I'm going to see plenty of daylight during the conference.
i certainly did imply that.
"i'm matt and damn am i popular online".
people try to add me as friends on doto now and im like 'nah, i've got enough'.
our wokfpack is pretty saturated.
We found the friends we were meant to find.
and he wont even talk to us.

i feel like we haven't made dota-friends with any randos in a long time.

"hey congrats on coming to america! let's sit in a room and not see the sunlight".
The conference is in Annapolis so that's where I'll be from 1-5 feb, but I can be wherever after/before that.
bring matt in the way that we met him, dota style.
Maybe that's when we should try and organize a LAN party like woody suggested long ago.
matt you're going to maryland, yeah? or DC proper?
Well I'll keep you guys posted, I'm definitely going to extend my trip a bit and whether it involves being a cheesy tourist around DC or getting drunk with you guys I'm up for it.

omg that feint.
You are welcome in Delaware whenever you would like.
Should I come up the weekend before (Jan 29) or stay for superbowl weekend?
oh, whether.
beginning or after.
what end?
So the conference is from the 1-5 Feb, and I'm wondering on what end I should extend my trip.

*final.
they just better win in the loser's bracket fianl.
i'm actually cool with it because tomorrow i get to see them play more.
Because doto rules.
Maybe they just do this so they can play more tournament doto.
i think they maybe approach winners bracket finals as a chance to understand their opponent and feel them out.
keeps them sharp playing all the way up until the finals.
Gg ez.
I almost feel like they enjoy it.
like i said though, EG have been in this position so many times in tournaments. DAC, TI5...I have confidence in them.
i agree, the s&y was a weird pickup that late.
IMO, if he really wanted to spin in for the magic immunity shouldve just invested in a BKB instead of the late S&Y. 
gg.
his physical damage can maybe hurt huskar, the spin damage doesnt even tickle.
he keeps bladefurrying at the wrong times.
arteezy doesnt seem comfortable on the hero.
jugg seems like such an odd pick.
"Perhaps..more money?".
I am the worst negotiator. I'm getting slaughtered at work.
RTZ spinning in like that is pretty much ass.
its a bunch of other teams that periodically come close, but never for a very extended period. EG and secret have been good for awhile now.
Maybe vega.
Strongest western and there is not a close third.
woops.
western.
Eg euro team lol.
> euro teams.
i think so. definitely the two strongest euro teams, alliance v. navi is a joke now.
Cap was calling eg secret the new el classico. Agree?
i'm confident enough in ppd that if they lose he'll figure out why and outdraft them in the finals. still though, it would be nice to have a guaranteed spot there.
or at least a very likely preview of it.
this is the finals more or less.
its super close.
this game is so good.
apaprently.
EG could probably come back and win?
did that recently. you just end up with blink dagger gaming.

Why would you stop there.

Youre right, they're great.

Too vivid Andy .
it'll be the view she sees when she's finished too.
Just stick that shit on there ^.
"So you got that going for you".
You got a D- on the test but a B+ on the BJ.
and then just put a sticky on the exam..."this girl blew me, note it".
I correct the exams and have to have a general knowledge of the material.
Treat her like casting couch. "S my D and let me pork you and I'll put a good word in with the prof".
so basically even if you wanted to you couldn't really help this girl at all?
this is a chemistry exam.

#what do andy and klaus jerk it to.
#who does he think i am?
maybe he's confused and thinks i'm someone important.
#whynot.
he could've just asked.
its mostly playing dota, jerking off and going to classes.
i don't lead a very interesting life.
mischief managed.
silly andy, you've been duped.
and is spying on you.
Maybe the mouse IS Snape.
oo an animagus.
fuckin cds.
#why?
#where is andy's mouse?
actually correct.
I bet a mouse would like a banana.
i will find some grain.
probably correct.
#what do mice eat?
I love animals, but I know their place.
not "vermin rool".
"birds rool".
#why?
cause klaus burned it down.
for someone who studies animals, you sure do hate them.
know why?
and then you'll never find you wallet andy.
he's friendly now, but next thing you know he's chewing up your wires and the BOOM your apartment burns to the ground.
I watched that video on Reddit about how smart / awesome mice are. I don't know what to believe in anymore.
canadians are vermin.
mice are vermin.
trust is difficult to earn with Klaus.
you should stomp him.
his life of abuse though has made him wary of new people in his life.
finally he found shelter in my appartment.
i imagine he lives a scared life. he used to be a street mouse, where he was bullied by the larger rats.
Give him a real bitch name like...Ronald Ma.
what sort of identity you think he has with an unspelled name.
he's shy though, so he never hangs out for long.
look andy you name a mouse, you have responsibility for how to spell its name.
I see him a few times a week.
for the unititiated, Klaus is the mouse that lives with me.
Klaus.
i'll ask next time i see him.
fuck idk how to spell his name.
i thought it was klaus.
claus?
sUN are you ever broken #?

I never know when that's broken.
intentional?
>mouseleum.
probably ordered the gigantic sausage pizza.
/political crack.
and i've got my millions with me in my mouseleum.
you can't benefit from killing anyone? we've killed an awful lot of brown people and gas is pretty cheap.
Andy doesn't even have any money.
so now he's broke and in jail.
so he wouldnt actually get the money.
you can't benefit from killing someone.
If I die on a Monday, make it rain at a strip club with all my money .
you're welcome cops.
counter point: he'd have andy's money.
no shit. eziest crime solve of my life.
thats a catch 22 though. he'd go to jail.
if i was murdered, i probably had it coming. have the killer come forward and collect my money.
i'm in my trusts and estates class right now.
"if i die of AIDs, don't give any money to trisha because i probably got it from her".
tight.
and if i die in neither way, burn my money.
but if i die in this way, leave my money to y.
if i die in this way, give my money to x.
you can make one will that has conditionals.
and it give syou an output.
here's a question: can you have multiple wills that have varying payouts depending on the circumstances of your death?
you type in all the variables (beneficiary a died, but benficiary b is still alive, asset a exists, but asset b no longer exists).
and ghosts are all physical damage, can be blocked with GA.
and the program itself acts as a reference in the event of a probate hearing.
but obey the 'ghosts can't move fast' rule.
the program then writes a will/trust/whatever which conforms to what you designed.
andy murders me: i haunt andy.
and you can build some kind've flowchart for what happens.
estate planning: basically you write rules into a program that shows what should happen to your assets if you die given various different circumstances.
Virtual YoYo.
I'm way ahead of you.
ok idea for an app/computer program/something.

and I'd jump in a rip my shirt revealing the T-shirt with your face on it.
and he would say "Oh yea, you and what army".
after some shoves you tell him "We're gonna kick your ass".
I want to come across one in the wild. Like they are standing at a point where their chest is at window height and it looks like Jon is peeking through a window.  Then the person lowers down and nope,  it's chuck testa.

Banks just want the thin shave off of that sweet sweet transaction .
I don't disagree. It's a solution to something that isn't really a problem. The additional security is nice, but that's kind of convoluted as well .
Seriously. You should not have so many CCs that you can't carry them .
i want to be in awe of how futuristic it is.
i want to NFC tap my phone for all transactions. most interaction i'd expect is selecting which card i want to use.
Its hard to beat just using a Credit Card.
I want to use Samsung pay but they don't support either of my cards now.

Can we talk about how chase pay sucks.
True. All about being first to the market .
Amazon's competitor to them just closed down.
I think they have some competitors w/ like PayPal and others but they had such a head start + really good software.
But if this was such a huge opportunity wouldn't you think some the big players (eg Chase) would come in and sweep Square aside?
I'll chop my penis off for 120 mil. Ez plastic surgery after I get that lesbo into me.
Yeah I understand some of the downward pressure, but square has such a yummy platform for small business. Missed opportunity. There will be reports about this in the coming days.
I think the initial  valuation of $9 was 40% below what square wanted so they kinda got fucked .

i vaguely remember going to a&w when i was a kid.
Get the fuck out of here, Canada boy.
LOL.
A&W all the way.
Remember when we pooped there.
I dont' think I've ever had a good experience at Wendy's.
remember when we went to wendy's like 3 times in key west?
Favorite fast food though is Wendys. 
Just predicting the future.
it sounds like "little fat girl".
i like that they have a menu item called a gordita.
Although I always get the same thing, two chalupas and a soft taco. Baha Blast.
I remember it being fucking awesome.
I think maybe a month or two ago I did.
has anyone eaten taco bell recently?
not gonna lie, those taco bell boss wrap things look amazing in the commercials.
glowballs op.
#what angle was that.
gg wp.
what was that angle.
shackle makes no sense.
yeah that initiation looked perfect, i dont understand how they only got 2 kills.
there's a ravage.
So the same as normal.
its what you deserve.
or maybe I just won't use his ult and only control one meepo.
i still tihnk i'll go 0-19.
matt just have cam coach you one game as meepo.
I want to make a hero called meepo so matt plays him.
you were standing there looking down in to the teamfight, didn't blink in, ravaged, hit no one, and then turned around and walked away.
it was pretty bad.
yeah, my blink got disabled right before i did it.
Tactical space creation.
andy remember that tide game where you had a hilarious ravage whiff from the mid radiant cliff?
LOL.
sheever-level ravage.
I would make a "Plague" style hero with a passive neutral gold debuff.
Tactical feeds.
PLD feeding.
secret looking sloppy.
lol.
armlet + mask of madness.
i guess like dagon, so he could pop it and die.
i wonder what items would be good on him.
basically a combo of venge aura, wk ult and sf ult.
like his job is basically to die at the beginning of fights and fuck the other team.
A farming debuff would be hilarious. Do you mean just some dude comes in and goes, hey fuck you, then pops out. 
lol that ravage.
like a farming debuff, a damage debuff and a bunch of other stuff.
what if there was a hero that gave a bunch of negative debuffs for killing him. kinda like venge's aura, but for all his skills.
wow tide farming ancients. what year is this.

I love that we gave up on them being stupid at the exact right moment when the alc came.
god that was funny.
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT!
Jon the invis rosh plays.
yeah, if the game is even somewhat close early i know its gonna be gg ez.
At the end I was like, "imagine if we werent fucking with you guys".
so ez.
i went mid against a tinker who didnt get a soul ring.
didn't even lose the early-mid game.
it was stupid.
we came online at like, 7 mins.
Deny aegis, fuck around until you dont wanna play anymore.
you stack camps and put your ion shell on the weakest creep.
They wouldnt wait for one of us to reconnect so i was like, now we're gonna be super disrespectful to you guys.
he can jungle pretty well.
"Works".
It works.
I've done ds jungle before, not planned, but just adapting to shitty picks.
Disrespect at 5 minutes. Next level. 
And if you can get the creep away from lane, the desolate dmg can help with last hits.
also, ds jungle? what kind've greedy shit is this.
Nothing beats how disrespectful we were last glowballs.
tide is good against spec, but chilling touch is good against tide.
Vb used to run spec mid.
tide will ruin spec in lane.
flawless logic.
>secret learning from cowboys butts confirmed.
and dark seer can run so fast that he's basically got a global presence.
and WR's powershot is basically global.
plus nightstalker for global dark.
rooting for my boys on secret already.
AA spec, semi glowballs.
yeah, i like tidehunter. he can be such a bully in lane too.
not a fan of the tide i see.
ravage is a pretty exciting spell IMO.
#oracle old meta.
>old meta.
i havent seen that hero in a pro match in awhile.
and a tidehunter on vici!

lifestealer confirmed shit hero.
gg, its over.
sick cogs.
clockwerk strong hero.
but as a 2, his ult is still good, but he doesnt bring a lot else to fights.
yeah thats what i'm saying. he scales compared to other 3 positions.
wait sumail doom wat.
doom scales because his ult is just "fuck you nerd lol did you have items or skills lololol".
get fuckin kited.
WHERE YA GOIN YA BISH???
LOL.
mr. steal yo base.
TRACK!!!
EG are fuckin rock stars.
@Woody what's the answer to the Eiffel tower?
omg. the fucking hook onto SMOKED heroes!
Doom scales so well in to late game.
RTZ on the SF is all you need in this life of sin.
EG!!!
that TP was fucking brilliant. Almost like he even knew the Bounty was coming. RTZ the God.
i just feel like eg chose 1 support, 3 offlaners, and a carry/mid. not entirely sure how that scales well other than the sf.
and yeah, he is super far behind. doom still a good spell though.
alright, eg arent totally out of this.
The Doom has to catch up.
It's over.
It'd take a few big items I think to turn it around. The Doom is still super irrelevant.
also, i feel like their heroes don't scale as well as cdecs so this is gonna be tough if they are behind early.
yeah, that was an awful fight for eg.
that arlmet.
nvm, Agressif just fucked them up super hardcore.
I think CDEC is playing better but since Doom is in the meta and LS isn't, i'd still tend to favor EG later.
yeah, plus he's fairly strong early game without really needing items. kinda like undying in a way.
NightStalker support is pretty cool. Tanky with a disable and silence.
Also lol the doomlings.
I havent been watching, what is he doing?
He's so versatile.
Yeah me neither.
I didn't really know that NightStalker could be used like this.
Eg take the series 2-0.
everyone go home.
yeah it's over.
matthew engl changed name to coolguy.

@Ham Metallica live is sweet.

If Roo gets Springsteen I'll go.
I kinda wanna go to a Metallica concert.
Primus and Tool are touring. That'd be mental.
its their 15th anniversary and it seems like they want to make a big deal of it.
I'm waiting to see Bonnaroo's lineup.
I'd totally see them again.
Tame Impala put on a great live show.
I like St. Lucia at 6 but then thats it.
Yeah steep drop for me at line 5.
i didnt catch much past like row 5 or 6.
It seems like Mumford & Sons, Florence, and Monsters & Men have been doing the festival circuit for the last 3 years now.
Headliners are good, midrange and low are pretty bad.
Yeah nothing there I'm super excited about. I saw M83 in 2012 and they blew me away. Hopefully they do the festival circuit this summer.
I dont know a lot about music, but I dont see anyone super exciting on that. Blink 182 is funny though.

source: Johnson, George B. Holt Biology: Visualizing Life. Orlando: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1994: 769.
Stomach capacity full is 4L.
The gallon challenge was hilarious. You ever vomited up cold liquid? Weird feeling.
Joel .
Give us the mean +- standard deviation.
@John Cena what animal managed to finish a gallon.
4.26 is upper limit.
I have .
and the parameters weren't clearly defined I feel.
The lactose induces vomiting outside of the volume.
Although that does seem a bit high for "average".
Have you ever seen someone finish a gallon????
what is your source?
 Think about people doing the gallon challenge. That's 4 trentas right there .
Me three.
yea I'm calling bullshit too.
Bullshit.
4.26.
woody whats the answer to the starbucks one?
Some mutha fuckin alpha.
Big days for me.
Yea.
Woah we talking coefficients of thermal expansion.
That shit is heavy.
It wouldn't.
It's already rocket-esque.
Sty what would happen to the Eiffel tower if we shot it in to space?
@mjd pls advise.
We should ask the resident engineer.
Then shave some off due to compression of weight.
Hold. A gallon is 128oz so I'd say 3-4 trentas assuming they're 30-32oz.
What's a good guesstimate for the average expansion of a meter of steel under heat vs contraction in cold.
It's one banana, what can it cost, 10 dollars?
The Eiffel Tower is what 1000 ft tall?
I'd say 2-3 trentas. And 2m on the Eiffel tower .
Let's just ask #kobe.
Average.. Stomach size is variable...
Yeah stomach expansion is way too variable.
In which case I keep my original estimation .
Because I think you have to just assume resting stomach capacity.
Is this accounting for stomach expansion?
Yea I think it's weird though and it's like 31 or 32 oz.
Trente is French for 30 so I'd say you're right.
Italian I believe.
The average stomach holds 2.4L.
I'd say 3 if that's the case.
30 oz maybe.
which was a big part of my guess.
you can't google anything but I'm pretty sure Trenta is 30 in some language.
Thats like 3 beers.
What's the volume of a trebta?
1?
Isn't it around 1 if filled only with liquid.
<1 trenta but that is assuming the cup is all drink.
Um... 5cm.

Something fun I've notice, my posture is so much better in the morning than at night that I have to adjust the rear view mirror every morning and night in my car.
#oracle 2008.
I think that's true in like 2008. I think battery tech evolved.
I mean, you have a limited number of charge cycles, but going on and off  'within a cycle' can't possibly be good for it.
I'm pretty sure it's not .
Agreed.
True. But I also feel like it's bad for your phone to keep taking it on and off the charger. Don't know enough about battery tech.
But until it's pervasive like that, the benefits are limited.
It's just not implemented the right way. If you put that tech in stuff you regularly put your phone on, like tables, then it's sensicle. Ikea has a line of charging furniture.
Seems like a gimmick to sell new phones to stupid people.
It's merely a convenience factor. It is slower too. 
Yeah but you can still pick up your phone when it's plugged in and it'll still charge.
Who has time for cables? If you do, then wireless charging isn't for you. 
yeah but you can just pick that shit up instead of unplugging it. It's pure laziness.
I just got voted head the the colonoscopy club so all of the above.
What's the appeal of wireless charging for phones vs cord? Don't you still have to keep the phone in one spot?

club memberships?
colonoscopies?

maybe even a bkb.
and sometimes a mek.
viper you need to press R.
remembering to set a hotkey for the spirit early is the key.
Viper is easier. Press no buttons, win.
things always work out with ET.
sometimes you have a spirit out, sometimes you dont.
just push buttons and win, its ez.

Problem: computer algorithm is fucked up
Cause: we had shitty interns
Solution: get better interns.
business venture: machine learning to create robotic interns.
so the future is "have interns do what we want computers to do eventually, then make the computers pretend to be interns".
Well the language in a review is more likely to be drafted in easy to understand format for general readers. I would like to see how that could get applied in a more convoluted string of words. I feel like that would be getting closer to machines understanding inference though.
They basically just manually looked at like 1,000 reviews and decided if they were positive or negative the. Used that data set to train the system which does reviews .
Yeah, I dont like the binary aspect of it though. Theres a lot of mixed reviews that get put in the positive column.
that is super neat.
Which reviews were positive or negative is completely computers decided.
Rotten tomatoes uses machine learning to detect positive / negative aspects of a review of a movie. 
LOL god matt. Get fuckin roasted.

>sorry.
i know, that's why we let you stay, matt.
People with special needs are still people, Michael.
Yeah lots of noise in there.
it's like running a psych analysis on a special ed class though.
well there are a number of emotes that mean sarcasm or joy or whatever so it probably would get you pretty close just based on the emote.
I think it would be relatively easy for them to run a psych analysis. You could easily track the mood of chats by mapping keywords along a positivity scale, normalizing along the whole sentence. With timestamps, you could tie reactions to specific events, and get a fairly direct  cause and effect. I'd like to see this across different sports and spectating mediums. Might be hard to determine genuine reactions and measure how invested someone is.
matt when you talk all i hear is �.
stuff like that is so cool.
@Woofy Someone wrote an "auto highlight generator" which captured video during chat spikes and string them all together to make highlight reels.

props to ehome, they had a lineup with a timing window and they executed.
25% movespeed and 60 attackspeed and tiny couldnt do shit.
yeah they kited the tiny way too easily and io couldn't stay alive in fights long enough to help.
that tiny got kited so hard.
rekt.
sigil slow is boning tiny.
if they fail, then i'm pretty sure that vega will win.
1 maybe 2. but yeah, they need rax soon.
i think ehome have one more chance to break base.
plus lanm's abbadon is saving everyone.
they tried to combo him a few times and failed. he's too tanky, and wand omg ez regen.
dk gets blownt the fug up by tiny's magic damage.
it's 20 mins in and ehome are about to break base.
dk mid, did well, very tanky hero in world today.
abbadon probably went with him, idk i haven't been paying the most attention to the game.
dk was mid? how did he get any farm vs wisptiny.
i think dk was mid, not entirely sure.
no qop and ss were in the safelane.
safelane dk?
good to see an abbadon picked though, i like that hero.
all vega has to do is pick the fights they take carefully and not fall too far behind.
none of ehomes heroes scale at all.
agreed.
if this game goes past 30 vega win.
gotem.
fuck dk.
more like e-go home.
push early with dk is the strat i guess?
although ehome don't even look like they have a carry.
i do know what you mean, there are a lot of alternative strength heroes to choose as carries.
lol.
TA and ember are sort of agi heroes. it's their primary stat but they're just physical damage. whatever, my point is a stupid one.
that hero is like almost techies level annoying to play against.
brood banned like every game ever.
i feel like it still is. gyro, sf, ta, ember.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
AGI ain't too popular this meta, is it.
ehome vega game 3, 7 str heroes and 3 int.

so probably.
thats what people used to do when there were less lategame options like moonshard.
maybe even necros to throw at buildings.
basically you will always have something to do with your cash if you are a late game alch.
true. refresher good also with his ult.
pretty ok with BKB + abyssal.
other notes, alch could have gone greedy and gotten the courier + refresher 7-slot.
but idk how that works either.
i feel like it would work like tree aghs.
i dont know.
this is the more important question.
if you steal walrus punch as rubick with aghs, do you also get walrus kick?
or even giving ta more stats.
having a tankier more useful rubik or clock has got to be more valuable than that.
but i would doubt he'd do that given he wasn't really dying.
yeah, he could have built himself an aghs before he gave it to anyone.
>kappa.
he replaced armlet because it's not a good item.
alch can eat an aghs himself, cant he?
i will note he had over 10 minutes, finished replacing armlet with mkb, and had 3k gold on him at least.
yeah welp we'll never know.
lol ez.
or they just win the game.
and its an alch.
like 2.5.
14 minutes for 4 items, basically.
but everytime they lose a fight he doesn't die so i think he is going to continue climbing in net worth.
but yeah, he'll probably replace armlet, upgrade boots, get a moonshard.
and mjolnir is a good item if you are getting kited because of the aoe.
lol ember sux.
thats ez.
probably eventually dumps mjollnir, too.
and he's an alch.
he has two slots to fill, plus bots level 2.
scratch that: 50 minutes.
alright, i'm gonna say that if this game goes to 55 minutes alch will have at least started building an aghs.
plus this game is super close, it could absolutely go late.
it just doesn't happen.
i bet he would have aghs money before 60 minutes.
late = 70+ minutes. super late.
it seems if it ever gets to that point, the game has already been won for a while.
did he have a rough early game? why no radiance?
i've seen some teams experiment with it, but yeah usually it wont be until very late that that happens.
that rarely happens in pro games i've watched.
aside from the obvious stats provided.
fun thing to note, only rubik and clock really benefit from aghs on the alch team if it goes late.
gyro2stronk.
only excuse is that he didnt have a remnent out, and in that case don't farm the side lanes.
but yeah, still a dumb move.
definitely wasnt expecting the first hit bash.
how does a pro ember get solo ganked by an alch successfully without a blink or shadowblade...jump to a remnant before the stun lands dummy.
bkb = unstoppable 
no bkb = highly farmed squishbag.
this is a great example of how valuable a BKB on alch is.
i hope team unknown wins this.
similar to andy's romantic advances.
hero is op if you dont have a good way to deal with him.

Phrasing.

I'm done guessing, gonna google. Wont share results though.
yes but storms come and go pretty quickly.
if there are 1000 storms, there arent 1000 storm-hours.
but it doesnt storm all day.
way too low IMO.
So overall still a good estimate.
I think number of storms is high but lightning strikes is low.
not all storms are lightening storms tho.
think of these huge storms that you see footage of where there's a strike like every 5 seconds.
Sounds reasonable.
No WAY is it 60s / strike.
I'm going 1,000 global storms at any time. 60s per strike in a storm = ~17 per second.
How many lightnings per second in the snow?
it is, however, snowing.
and from looking out the single window in my office I can say with 100% certainty that it is not storming in the 2nd largest country on the planet.
equatorial regions in the pacific are full of storms.
Nope.
then we just extrapolate.
matt is it storming in caada.
andy is it storming in dc.
lets just do averaging.
yes.
i guess the ocean inflates it?
100 storms seems low. I was going to say 1,000 storms.
At least 2-3.
Idk, I feel like if we count internal strikes theres more than 1 per minute.
maybe 1 / min / storm.
4 strikes / minute / storm seems high.
Thats 400 per minute.
so 100 storms / world / day seems ok.
mike there are way more storm systems than that.
And like 4 lightning strikes per minute for each.
period.
No googling at all.
Okay so lets say there are like 100 lightning storms at any given time on earth.
lets say there are 4 storm systems in NA / day.
big space in universe today.
and space.
lots of that.
and ocean too.
think of how big the world is!
yeah.
Each second?
3000/second? you're high.
something like 3000.
Not a lot.
I remember reading this stat once and it is absurdly high.
How often are there lightning storms on the east coast?
can we google auxiliary details.
I think thats probably right.
seems low.
someone find a way to flip all the kobe gifs upside down so i can implement #ebok.
so 60 storms in the world at any given time?
storm*.
I was thinking there is about 60 seconds between lightning in a sotrm.
That actually sounds right.

I definitely remember a real game where you didn't level silence until some absurd level.
Overthrow throws the rules aside. 
those are hard facts right there.
are we talking about the overthrow, or the last game i played as silencer? because i did level that one at 6.
We did win though. Hard to argue with results .
maybe keeping the surprise factor until like... level 7 would be ok. not til level 16 at 30 mins in the game.
we won that game, so obviously nothing i did was ever wrong.
the surprise factor is extremely important.
Mike how do you know these things but still not level global silence at level 6?
>gotem.
eh shouldn't have said that. you guys take long enough to get out of the fountain anyways.
I also didn't know that.
there's an aegis shield behind each shopkeeper. ~~the more you know~~.

Team slayer is really just winning or not. That playlist is tough without squadding up and doing callouts.
The 'win' is only for 1st place in ffa. But, I think you can increase your csr simply by placing higher than people with higher csr. in the underlying rankings for it. I only actually 'won' one game of ffa, but was staying in the top half for the rest of the matches.
team slayer you have almost 50/50.

Hi andy.
yeah, huskar can be fantastic, or he can suck ass. i agree with stu, ta was just such a good counterpick.
there were too many eggs in the huskar basket.
always wasted shallow grave.
blew him up.
ta was a smart counter.
such a stupid pick.
huskar was useless.
also eg takes game two ez.

I'm watching.
sumail might have just done the stupidest thing ive ever seen.
is anyone watching this.
omg.
you were probably playing candy crush and got frustrated.
Cracked my ipad screen last night while I was playing music I suppose.
is that why you pooped?
was there a pretty girl in your room?
Once I got to my room I pooped .
no shirt no shoes no problems.
gave er the ol' hambone last night eh?
I didnt have shoes or a shirt either.
Stride of Pride, Jon.
Did the worst walk of shame this morning in a pink fucking tutu.
Wonderful thing that I didnt have my phone last night.
turns out venge isn't that great of a carry. who knew?
major spoiler alert: VP are getting crushed somehow.
one hilarious time. dragons played dotes with us last night.
Also where has @Dragos Dasoveanu been?
I'm supportive and friendly 99% of the time.
One time. That happened only once.
No �.

so fuckin ez.
omg moke ez.
>ez.
no thx to slardar.
duh.
yeah thats his W.
eg currently crushing with slardar.
>come at me.
offbane suggs, es armlet suggs, slardar suggs.
what, you don't believe in position 4 roaming viper matt?
off bane is the greatest, and I feel satisified that it was run by secret when they were good.
it also helped that the other team was -really- bad.
"we're going to run at you. then, after we run at you, we're going to run at you again. then just sort of repeat that until we win".
and it was hilariously effective.
... Off bane!
brain drafted this draft.
All of this strategy is no match for....
http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1932001487.
probably helps that ds has less hp than a lot of other offlaners.
*good.
it does like 135 (?) damage which is pretty goid.
no its actually one of the more efficient level 1 nukes i think.
isnt that mana intensive?
gonna consider it in the future if i'm zoning.
no. no you dont.
no.
omg mike do you know anything?
he leveled his nuke first.
not what they used.
shackles + barrage is a lot of damage.
even got first blood on him.
they kept ds lvl 1 with a gyro ss duel lane for like 5 minutes.
yeah, they have lineup designed to do well early and they have not at all done it.
VP have to push like madmen at like...25 minutes.
dk gg go next.
I think VP is a meta behind here.
VP: AA, Venge, WW, DK, DS.
EG: CM, Slardar, WR, Gyro, SS.
what are the drafts.
eg crushing the early game.
currently watching as well.
"im mike and i watch more pro dota than is really all that reasonable".
and yes.
"im mike i know everything".

he did that earlier in the year.

we were like, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
he was like 10-0 and had the T2 down at like 8 minutes.
and I think brood last picked that game.
but you could have gotten boned on pick orders. that will happen.
hrm i think if i had the option, going a jungler into a brood seems like a weak choice. leaves that safelane super vulnerable.

Normally like a 12 inch girthy sausage .
Stu is definitely meat based .
Classifying something other than maybe crimes based on intent seems foolish.
It must be another arbitrary culinary term. Like vegetable.
Apparently it's about intent.
Oh. Heartiness then maybe but that's subjective.
I googled it.
No. I was wondering.

LOL boss ross is fuckin hilarious.
> He also had to find a way to cut back on spending, so he decided to have his hair permed, just so he could save money on haircuts. The perm hairstyle was not comfortable for Ross, but ultimately became an iconic feature of his image.
This Wikipedia page is great. 
> Having held military positions that required him to be, in his own words, "mean" and "tough", "the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work", Ross decided that if he ever moved on from the military, he would never scream again.
I like imagining that he took up painting because he was disgusted with humanity. It would also explain why he never draws people.
> Ross enlisted in the United States Air Force at age 18 and went on to serve as a medical records technician.[3]:15 He eventually rose to the rank of master sergeant and served as thefirst sergeant of the U.S. Air Force Clinic atEielson Air Force Base in Alaska.
The second sentence is a popular belief but he was a soldier.

Wasnt bob ross a war veteran? And he picked up painting as a post traumatic activity. This could all be coming out of my butt.

Weird guy.
We also bough him a sex doll as a joke for Christmas. Her name was Bertha. One day like a month after Christmas, I walked in to my room and Bertha was hanging from the ceiling and he stuck an electric razor in her sexhole and she had ketchup all around her nasty bits to look like blood and he wrote a suicide note from her.
I had a guy who would constantly prank me. For like, months, my bed would always have crumbs in it and I couldn't figure out why, and I always suspected it was him but he denied it vehemently. One day a friend walked in and he was eating crackers on my bed making a huge mess and he just put his finger up to his lips and said 'shhh' and she walked out.
Classic Phil.
thats kinda nice actually. more time to yourself.
I had Phil Redpath who was from Charlottesville so he went home every weekend and multiple nights a week.

Twins, except mine would wear briefs only. And he told a girl on the floor that he would have his way with her if he found her dead on the side of the road before he called the cops. Had an elephant trunk for a Dick though.
i basically only went to my dorm to sleep, and that was only when i wasn't spending the night at my gf at the time's place.

That was a twist. A costume wedding?
The wedding?

My family always gives me shit about it, so I think it'd be funny. But then part of me doesn't know how all the other people at the wedding would think about me wearing a pink fairy costume at age 23.
jon pls post that photo for science.
The best idea I have is to print out a very embarrassing photo of myself when I was really young where my mom dressed me as a fairy and re-do that photo today with myself in a fairy costume.
I have to think of a costume for a ThrowBack party on Thursday.
I like princess Carolyn's ring back "when you walking alone and jellicles are and jellicles do...".

i don't know enough abotu existentialism to refute you.
diane interacts with todd in the one about the chickens, and it's actually a pretty neat exchange.
i think that pretty directly covers bjhm.
>approach that emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will.
I like the dynamic between characters in R&M better I think. Like rarely will Diane interact with Todd. 
lol wut?
hrm i guess bj h-man pretty directly comes out and says, "you can find happiness but you gotta work at it" which is then existentialism?
"You gotta get your shit together. Get it all together. Put it in a backpack...".
life is meaningless is moral relativism.
boo go write a 12th grade essay andy.
^^^thats just rephrasing it in a more clever way.
morty doesn't accept this, and sometimes he can convnce rick.
naw, it's that life is meaningless, let's watch tv.
the overall "moral" of the rick and morty universe is that morality is relative.
like when he was trying to save fart.
Yeah like when he tells Summer that he killed and buried himself .
he does, but half the time he ends up being wrong about a situation.
especially morty. he has a lot of kyle broflovski-style speeches.
i dunno, r&m is pretty willing to explicitly moralize.
True. I suppose BoJack's thoughtful and dark moments are very obvious, where you can tell the difference in the tone of a character when they want to make a point. Whereas R&M might do a better job of hiding it within the comedy. 
hahaha.
you're just baiting out futurama quotes now.
and that makes writing a lot easier.
rick and morty has an easier time putting everything back where it was at the start of the episode i think is the point i'm making.
bojack also has throwaway episodes, but you can only do bojack being self-destructive and narcissistic for so long before all of the episodes where he "grows" come off as disingenuous.
and a formula is one thing, putting in the plot elements makes it harder.
"I didn't think Kabuki theaters had projectors?" "Some do.".
obviously not every episode follows this formula, but a lot do.
r&m stories will always be available along the lines of: take a sci-fi idea, rick does something that seems morally questionable to morty, morty tries to do the "right thing", the "right thing" backfires tremendously, morty realizes there's a reason for ricks dont-give-a-fuck attitude.
*Palmela.
i bet jon steals catalogs from sears and uses those for his visits with Pamela Handerson.
r&m can do almost anything -- because it's space, scifi -- but choosing something that makes sense out of that infinity of choices is a task in its own right.
Andy probably watched the 'for women' category during his porn and watches the full 35 mins.
i feel like its the opposite mike. whereas r&m has an easier forumla to follow, bojack's story kind've has to progress since its about broken characters and their growth.
Unless Evil Morty gets Rick out of trouble. I hope thats what happens. 
It might be because i'm currently watching BoJack but its at least a close race. 
i think bojack has an easier niche to continue the story with than r&m.
bold claim.
I think I might enjoy bojack more than Rick and Morty.
i bet dragos gives good hugs.
thats not so bad.

I can't go on it at work or else I just start laughing and people look at me.
me_irl is too funny.
also reading that roast_me subreddit has me wanting to toss out sick burns left right and center. woody, you missed a half decent one when you left to go make garlic nuts.
it's already a magical place.
the only subreddits I actively follow are dota2, reactiongifs, listentothis, and nfl.
i would also like to meet some of the people that comment on the porn subreddits. not in person, but maybe through some moderately thick plexiglass.
im just gonna unsubscribe from everything except rdota2 and me_irl. reddit would just be magical.
I imagine Mike's reddit is all gonewild and meirl.
are you afraid someone is gonna see that you enjoy bikes and dota?
i only make decisions worth standing by. throwaways are for cowards.
^make a throwaway.
so like everyone has 1000 positive points they can give out and 500 they can subtract.
my username is already super non-anonymous.
also /r/roastme, attaching your own face to your reddit account, bold move.
each month is basically a "season" and sUN posts the totals at the end of the month.
sUN keeps track of how many points people have and how many points they can give out.
everyone has a set number of positive and negative points they can give out each week to anyone but themselves.
alright here's how i envision it.
andy please tell me your thoughts so i can either ignore them or subvert them, along the lines of jajajajaja.
someone on tinder send that message to a girl and post results.
#oracle i find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.

#oracle wouldn't have hit land until Asia.

also just the fact that he managed to come across basically the only islands for thousands of miles is super lucky, otherwise he wouldn't have hit land until asia.
but that story was fucking nuts.
no.
drum roll.
A set number of points that can be distrubuted per week/day?
I just can't think of a way to make it non-abusable.
Also since I'm the only one apparently bored at work: we should have a point system where you can award people in chat arbitrary points and sUN keeps track.
bonus points to anyone who submits their pic.
people post pics and then get insulted.

andy has cowboy boots for his romps through the gay clubs of DC.
it's like a dog wearing pants. it's not funny because it makes sense, it's funny because it doesnt make sense.
why would Andy have cowboy boots?
He needs to break into MY house and write "Andy" on my shoes.
i will reimburse you for transportation but i will require receipts.
doesnt need to.
that doesn't make sense.
woody i will give you $1 if you break into andy's apartment and write "WOODY" on the bottom of his cowboy boots in sharpie. i will also provide the sharpie.

Stu you missed you calling in Marketing.
The darkest before dawn is like a direct metaphor of using dawn to clean oil.
i considered it only after stu had asked, but i had thought it too slant of a joke.
No one could have made the "Dawn" into "The Dawn label has ducks" connection.

Maybe just eat a chicken.
Damn now I wanna do an all day BBQ .
If I wanted to soggy bbq I'd just soak it in a bowl of water.
If I wanted to consume a sugary messy slurry I'd get ice cream, not bbq.
Pork? Vinegar. Chicken? Tomato. Beef? Mustard.
Women can be wrong.
Why not both!
Andy women can have opinions.
Wrong sUN.

I did get an invoker sunstrike kill in that game though. was almost worth it for that.

You guys need to be up at 6am.
we gotta get you some friends buddy.

What about just with large balls? #last.

Stealing duel as rubick. Discuss.
I throw balls far.
Legion hit hard. Ruby, not so much.
When I dueled that Legion I was like, 'oh yeah, time to rub it in this guys face'. The first tick of my life after the first hit I quickly realized, 'I've made a huge mistake'.
Remember when jon doomed the buyback legion? G-G.
(Tinker not techies).
Is aghs a real thing on him?
Tinker at least requires some mechanical skill. But yeah, that hero is also tough to play against.
remember when jon dueled.
Probably eziest game of my life.
does it make you feel any better that i used my evil powers to thwart a tinker from pushing?
1 mine = 1 wave dead.
aghs mines still stronk.
At least he sucks now.
so lower your hate values by ~50%.
There's a reroll button.
i randomed.
sUN refuses to give you stats on your shitty hero choice.
does last still not work for techies? i aint mad about that.
#last i played techies and i did techies things then i got carried to victory ez gg.

One of the ways of our people of eating pork, yes. 
Bring the pig so we can kill it .
I'm kidding Matt. Come to America, we will show you the ways of our people.
Who, matt?
I wouldn't. I draw much delight from it. Laughter, a bit of disgust, lots of confusion. Its a wonderful creature to hate. 
I'd take delightfully out of that sentence.
I screenshot every Snapchat I receive of that pig, matt. Its so delightfully revolting.

My sister is in Burma right now.

The blood seeker ES combo was attempted and won everytime.

you're not my real dad.
Don't smoke pot andy.
i did not know that.
really?
lessons for life.
you are not a hero when you're stoned.
the mines will go off after they are not stone.
i usually needed to take a shower.
What if they're stone. Do they still die to mines if ES kicks them there .
its how i feel after i used to play against them.
which is hilarious.
I think there is a word association with Rape and Techies.
Andy's fave heroes.
kick onto mines literal rape confirmed.
guess it was only 2 things.
#oracle and why is it rape.
huh.
#oracle what is requirement #3?
i'm not a player i just crush a lot.
gotta be into it, i get that.
Also ash is a scrub because his major goal in the game was to stop team rocket from being mean to pokemon. Future protagonists were tasked with stopping a time / space / dimension collapse. Pussy.
#what's requirement #2?
there are at least two other requirements.
Oh shit.
andy's checklist: has a pulse.
I'm not ashamed, you gotta know what your about.
she's not wrong.
ok sorruy.
#oracle woody likes asians.
#gif Ron on the Knight.
I'm a complex individual.
I like that he rode the knight. Everyone else just stood to replace their piece but not Ron. He rode his piece.
woody surprised you prefer the ginger over the asian.
LOL.
i can talk to snakes, i just cant understand what they say back.
"Knight to H3" - OG Ron moment .
Yea, she was way hottter than that Cho Chang girl.
*gotta.
gott give him props for that.
He knew how to talk to snakes! that was useful.
he banged ron's sister.
didnt he like accidentally swallow the yellow birdy thing.
that came into play like 2 or 3 times.
he was good at quidditch.
He looked the mirror of Erised in the eye and got the fancy stone.
he survived hogwarts. that school was a death trap.
Woah Woah Woah.
Dude didn't do shit on his own. 
Harry Potter is also a scrub. 
i doubt it, he's the king of scrubs.
 did ash ever beat a gym leader on the first try? I can't remember one time.
he's technically a villain so it make sense his story would be dark, but yeah i didnt expect that.
except i guess sub out team rocket for theater.
i'd call that "high school".
what a fucking dark and sad story.
What a nerd.
"he studied really hard then they called him a nerd".
The golden rule.
Wasn't getting it with charizard. Not his type.
butterfree forgot the bros before hoes rule.

plus, butterfree spoke to my heart.
i watched the show bitch.
bad joke is bad.
did you imagine a pokemon talking?
what are you talking about.
andy, meowth never talked.
in the show, why could meowth talk, but the other pokemon could only say their own names?
cuz we all know what mr mime was doing in the show.
Jon you'd be meowth.
he'd be fucking your mom?
Youd be mr. Mime and be my house bitch.
nvm alliance not doing it.
so sUN can decide.
pokemon command is next.
Youd think wrong.

I don't have to guess that armlet on earthshaker sucks.
but the magic lifesteal and lowered cds might make it worth it, after heart?
i guess heart gives you over 500 more health.
Armlet on Earthshaker sucks.
oh octarine, i thought you meant refresher. dont buy it.
it serves  a similar purpose to heart in making you tanky, plus you get lifesteal from your radiance and dispersion damage.
as a sixth item maybe.
is octarine spec a thing people have done yet? it feels like it could be good.
refresher spec ez.
^that is such a hilarious np build, i love it.
the flares, but also just everyone ulting on top of clock.
np has aghs + octarine + refresher.
yeah, most i ever see is 2 or 3.
the flares.
true but at the very least they are committed to it.
people never understand that until they see it in action.
but they still should have picked clock.
>nice.
+ trusty tusky.
spec zeus aa NP.
spectre, zeus aa?
i am in class so i can't watch. other than tusk, who is on their team?
45 minutes glowballs getting stronger.
I could see bat going aghs before bkb depending on the enemy lineup though.
True.
yes bat. aghs is probably only good on tusky if an alchemist gifts it to you.
damn.
Yeah travels are good on him.
I forgot we were talking about bat, not tusk.
more like in the jim.
Im in the gym.
Who are we talking about.
Farm map .
mom used to be somewhat core on him, too.
move speed + presence.
When would travels ever be a priority on that hero?
this is a very classic glowballs game. i see every glowballs we ever run in it.
s4 played him a couple of times recently. i think the problem is that you have other priorities (travels blink force bkb).
keeps me in the meta at least.
and thats my only exposure.
it's been listening to twicth casting for me.
jon. I too will enjoy it.
New batrider aghs seems legit though, I'm surprised he hasnt been getting picked.
Yeah, in pro matches I've only ever seen it when the team with tusk was way ahead.
mostly a disrespectful play.
it is but nobody builds aghs on him.
Did they buy aghs on him? I have yet to see that be any good.
Walrus kick still a thing?
but i see they're in the "lose the early and midgame" point of glowballz.
nip didnt commit to glowballs. tusk doesnt count.
Stu. When you play dota again, ill be very happy.
NiP is running a full glowballz right now.

^unintended pun.
he has to sleep sometime right?

The limit does not exist .
the system works!
asked, delivered.
#gif beedrill.
Beedrill a real OG.
Beedrill no?
maybe focus energy for harden.
will accept recover instead of rest.
is there a pokemon that can learn harden, horn drill, string shot, and rest?
sometimes i wonder why fidel won't do voice calls. other times i don't.

did i 3?
matt, did you ever play meepo.
look at banner michael!
Ill make a banner and bring my DSLR and film it like an episode of Chopped .
i get at least two half sandwiches out of this competition; why wouldn't i campaign for it to occur.
We'll make this happen.
you're not wrong.
also @Andy Esposito  this is a classic whiskey talk conversation where we decide to do something but then never do it.
Stu, OK.
Woody, I'm making a pull request within the next 10 minutes.
also Jon you reminded me.
do it at SXSW.
Not until matt plays meepo.
if i win mike has to play an armlet earthshaker game.
my victory is going to be so much better knowing you were the one who decided it.
everything is bigger there, like the shame of your defeat.
i guess we're doing it in texas.
no, no, austin.
because in either case, cville has to be the better option.

24 hours?
I need time constraints to know how crazy I can go.
blind taste test with mike and jon judging?
#what will be the next topic of sweet profile pix (he asks, knowing that sUN refuses to acknowledge his requests).
but yeah, its like my favorite food, so i would totally be down to learn to make it for the sake of a cookoff.
DAMN SON!
OOOO.
Also I like how he stuck with the dog profile pic which was like 3 metas ago.
andy knows brackets in a rainman-like level of detail.
WE'VE GOT A COOK OFF.
I'll give Andy spreadsheet credit. I won't tread there. Mans got numbers and stuff.
for you?
i said i would get the recipe. how hard could it be?
Cause it had basil. I'm positive.
Walk me through how to make tomato sauce.
i made a spreadsheet.
"math".
i did the math.
i do know.
rip.
just like you know armlet is a good item on ES.
you do you, but i know that whatever frankenstein basil infused bullshit you brought would lose.
Which Mike does a lot.
unless you're challenging him so you can eat what he makes.
challenging woody to cooking is a fool's errand.
I'd do some research and bring the hammer.
No no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q84nfWkLsYU.
ez gg.
i will just get my mom's recipe and crush you.
Also logistically I'm not sure how we'd pull it off.
I'd challenge you to a chicken parm cook off but I'm positive the basil option would win.
probably.
was the Dominos an Equal Opportunity Employer?
thats dumb.
disagree.
Who appreciate flavor.
Fucking smart people.
was the grease filled with flavor?
who the fuck puts basil on a chicken parm sandwhich?
was the oven hand made in germany?
nope.
Any fresh basil straight from local farmers?
no, it was in a greasy oven.
tempted to order one now to see for myself.
Was the bread artisan baked Andy! Was it!
no and no.
we didnt ask for mediocrity.
Was the cheese aged to perfection? Was the sauce slowly simmered all day like grandma used to make it?
you guys fucking asked.
was the chicken free range?
omg andy this review blows.
chicken was chicken.
sauce was fine, cheese was good.
#oracle let me in that head of yours.
bread was kinda crunchy but a bit too greasy.
let me in that head of yours.
pretty hard to fuck up, but it wasn't that great either.
so? texture? spices?
one which would be compromised by writing a thorough review.
it was a chicken parm sandwhich, it had cheese, breaded chicken and marinara sauce.
there must be a very narrow eating-window on this sandwich.
thats not a review.
Andy your review went from "too hot to eat or touch" to "it was filling but it's gone".
How would you make it better andy.
sty review: 10/10 great guy.
Woody review andy review: π/10. Sentence structure is irrational.
Andy review: 4/10. Not good at picking sand which places or building ES.
sandwich review btw: 5/10. not bad, filling but probably wouldn't get again.
#oracle armlet earthshaker.
#oracle rip.

i dont even have to have a comeback for taht.
when i hit 6k mmr, i'll dumpster you shitstains with my awesome build.
Against a tinker and lina .
ill go eth blade to protect you from your bad idea.
and after i get blink and force i'm gonna buy a goddamn armlet every time.
earthshaker is a fun hero, i might play him more.
i'd rather be six-slotted with 6 armlet recipies.
i'd rather cut off my left nut.
Armlet on earthshaker, thoughts everyone?
still needs a force staff.
manta diffusal fv as a counter to wk. thoughts?
i wish FV was more popular so jon would play more venge and have sweet mlg plays.
Remember Jon's stellar venge plays last night? Pepperidge farm remembers.
Rip.
also i bet you have zoos, dingus.

i'm talking to one.

>there are no monkeys in canada.

dirty snow monkeys.
so thats where all of california's water went...canada.
jokes on you! no water bills in most of canada.
unless you fill from home.
buy a reusable water bottle: water magically becomes free.
everything that isn't tap water is incredibly overpriced but thats just how the world works.
to be fair, bottled water is super overpriced.
wayside fucks.
Only matches by wayside which is cheaper than bottled water.
outrageously high.
deliciousness per dollar ratio is incredibly high.
Fuck stu.
but is not #1.
I paid 1/3 times but the one time I paid it was for 3 people...
bodos is good.
jon i thought we were friends.
Team bodos is just ok.
i had bodos twice today, only paid once.
I had bodos for breakfast 3 days in a row. Step back .
taking that picture hurt.
i had bodos for lunch suck it nerds.
right now, its too hot to eat or even hold.
Are we sharing what we are eating?
alright now play-by-play us through the sandwich experience.
No.
Put it in that random girl's mouth and send a pic so I can judge size better.
Did samir try and snitch on everyone.
We had a super easy opportunity to come forward and share the blame and we did nothing. We just sat there and let Samir get destroyed.
I actually apologized like 3 years later. I still feel kinda bad about it.
I was there and was guilt ridden.
hold it in your hand so i can judge size better.
Chicken parm from dominos .
jon, good job not getting in trouble.
I could be wrong.
I wasn't there. But i would have.
And I feel like max did too.
Jon definitely threw some.
*I.
Is was there but threw none so I am guilt free.
**he only threw three but was forced into the detentions because 0/7 people standing around him owned up.
Which is hilarious.
the english language is not sufficient to handle that sentence jon.
I think they actually got the same amount of detentions.
Meanwhile others burned a dick in a field and were completely fine.
He only threw three but took the heat for all of them.
no to mike, not to andy. andy is right.
no.
And to save you guys the time, subway is big everwhere. Its the most common franchise.
Remember when Samir got 12 detentions because Mr Mitchell though he threw all those airplanes out the window?
how miserable.
oh no.
The subway is like 1 door down from me. I'd have to walk like 2 blocks for potbelly.
their sandwiches are like, all hot.
quiznos isn't that hot.
jon, good memory of DC.
subway is pretty big up here in canada.
potbellys is the tits.
potbelly tho!
Plenty of potbellys.
they also love Captain D's.
try to make a friend in line to share your bogo with.
tennessee loves some fucking subway.
And there is no nearby quiznos.
And subway is not bad for a lunch that costs < $5.
"hello yes, i'd like one order of the wish-i-had-gone-to-quiznos".
*big.
I went with chicken parm sandwich because I'm a bug fat fatty.
also why the balls are you going to subway, that place sucks.
isnt it just they're cutting foot longs in half.
Send picture as well.
Will report results.
That makes a lot of sense. Line was too long so I said fuck it and am now waiting on a sandwhich at domino's.
yeah fucking right subway.

BOGO on sandwiches.
Sorry.

Also, is something happening at subway? The line is out the door.

To clarify we didnt do that.
airplane.
>airplabe.
we put a goddang man on the moon, we can make a big paper airplabe.
probably not, but I'm sure you could find some folding-locking mechanism that would work.
Or must it be a pure paper airplane?
Is tape allowed?
40 1ft sheets of paper....
Where would you find more than 40ft of paper? I feel like you are overlooking some things.
i can provide some birds for flight reference.
moke and sty, i leave this one in your court.
I'd say as long as you kept your proportions straight and had some king of folding-locking mechanism for the paper you could easily top 40 ft.
couple of practice throws and call Guinness.
Go somewhere high with the paper and baby you are 90% there.
get more than 40 feet of paper and you are like 80% done.
we could top that ez.
woah, the wingspan record is only 40 feet.

>props to woody for getting so close though.
HOLD.
...and then for some reason our company stopped the "Estimation question of the day".
theres an excel sheet with all the dulles stats.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10nC3CccNjzjUPP6MBx11lpK5LtmECXniwjgYfcEqXqE/edit?usp=sharing.
do you remember mrs. chiluchi's questions she would put on the board before math class?
dulles: "fewer dudes than your mom has boned".
you should answer all the trivia questions with your mom jokes.
>REKT.
obvious answer I guess.
>Less than your mom.
The last question was "How much does Hawaii weigh".
that's 2/3 of canada.
21,572,233 was the total number of passengers for 2014.
August 2015 average about 66000.
im sure we screwed up miami by being three people short.
im sure the exact same number of people leave dulles each day.
those all seem way too close to the real thing though.
but idk.
i found 60,000.
no, it's 64 001.
Is the answer 64,000?
claim kangaroo court.
someone cheated.
Current guesses are: 52,620, 54,000, 64,000 and 64,001.
that gives me 360 flights per day, 150 people per flight.
that is a very clever way to think about it.
turnover guess seems bold.
and the screen "turns over" every 4 hours.
I assumed there were 4 TV screens each with 20 flights.
I went by looking at the number of "Arrivals" TV screens.
1000 flights a day => 10 flights / gate / day.
props to woody for getting so close though.
yeah i don't know enough about how airports work to really do the whole number of planes per day estimate.
>you must construct additional pylons.
but not all gates are active at once.
i think planes/hour/gate boned me worst.
apparently 100 gates.
all the way back to 62!
so many stats.
http://www.mwaa.com/about/dulles-air-traffic-statistics.
>sorry.
andy you shouldn't have spoiled it so quickly!
Lol.
there we go.
and im wrong.
adjust for off-peak hours, say 16 hours/dar.
75 pasengers / plane.
2 planes / hour / gate.
ok so lets say 50 gates.
Woody was closer, I just looked up the answer.
I'm not sure how big the airport is, but I think your estimate of 20-30 planes per hour is low.
Dc.
Would be my guess but i have no idea.
first question: where is Dulles airport?
Ok, 200ish/plane (5-6 per row and like 35-40 rows). Probably 20-30 planes per hour. 24 hours a day. Thats like 100k.
I said 54,000 but that seemed kinda high.
You're not allowed to look anything up.
The estimation question at work today is "How many passengers fly through Dulles airport each day".
that's all you need.
i understand zero of the words but all of the funk.

So people would search for books in your app as opposed to Amazons app.
"Basically I have this idea for an app where you can search for books and then you can go and buy the book from Amazon. I am an amazon affiliate marketer so I want to somehow put my amazon link to each book in the app. Then people can click on it and it gives me commission. ".

would you say the game was.... doomed from the start.

do ships use keys?

the only thing he's stolen is my heart.
pretty good butt pirate though.
he'd lose the keys to the ship.
Andy would be the worst pirate. He wouldn't know where any of the passengers or where the ship was.
icebergs cant sink steel ships.
the titanic was an inside job.
how are you going to sink the ships?
Fuck capturing anything. Why am I gonna do with a big tanker.
I would just sink the ships. Then rescue the survivors for a profit.
live the dream.
you should pirate "hitman" the game woody.
awful hitman, but great pirate.
poor hitman, great pirate.
I've decided I would be a great pirate. 
to be fair, if i was in the arctic and i got covered in water, that would really suck.
dark.
or like black people in the 60's.
they say nothing takes you out of the pillaging mood like being soggy.
the answer to guns i always more guns.
Like a dog who has been a bit bad.
Maybe this is why the Pirates keep pirating. They use guns and all we do is squirt water at them.
i was just as confused as you guys are now.
it's efficient to gift-wrap it in barbed wire?
I guess for really large vessels this is the most efficient way to secure the vessel.
They'll just be back, and in greater numbers.
I would also use guns against pirates? Why water and barbed wire?
Erika is a mean shot, I wouldn't cross her with a gun.

BEWARE PIRATES.
They should just put pictures of ronnies face all along the sides of the boat. Scare them off real quick.
I'm not making this up.
this is the recommended international standard.
I actually went through this international training program for at-sea safety, and there was a part about pirates. LITERALLY: the method to protect yourselves from being boarded by pirates is to cover the rails of the ship with barbed wire (our ship had tons of it on deck) and then you set up high-powered hoses to soak the pirates as they approach.
"we call them land sea lions. i tame them".
I suppose sea lions would be your biggest threat, but if you get close enough to one that it becomes a threat then you're a goddang idiot and dont deserve to live.
You don't really need them in Antarctica because there are no bears down there.
i ask this because i watched "the thing" recently, and they had a ton of guns and axes for an antarctic science base.
we needed them when we went ashore to protect the passengers from polar bears.
Lookin for the booty.
butt pirates.
Pirates. 
why did your ship have guns.
it rocked.
When I was up north we had a whole new set of firearms for the ship, and none of them had been fired. So one night all the gun bearers got to go to the back of the ship somewhere off the coast of greenland and fire all our guns.

so we won.
but they did not.
the fuck were their lanes?
they had a doom and venge, they probably could have contested jons farm a bit.
honestly, i think they're big issue was not being more aggressive in lane.
i like when you get strong enough that they see you in the sentry and they just bail bail bail.
I like the mindgames riki has to play. Stay somewhere when people think the team leaves then shit on this face. Understand where sentrys might be randomly placed so you can play nightcrawlers. 
thanks, i'd like to thank merriam-webster.

I think those were good. Straight forward drawing of boobs. 
Raven is not pleased .

Liz has boobs and that's the best she could do??
The face of your drawing photo bombing that is so good. 
Liz's try.
Great image for me.
I'm imagining you have porn up and are thoughtfully considering it while drawing.
Yeah that was a dick.
Remember when I used that Svedka to clean it. I think it worked .
I dont clean my whiteboard much, so its just orange marker from awhile ago.

I dont want liz to be embarrassed because her costume was half assed.
Its also extra funny cause its fucking boobs.
I feel like a pervy old man on this train looking at shitty titties.
LOL.
I fucking love this so much. I need an Andy drawing segment during my week where we give andy something to draw and he sends the photo.
#oracle more Arreola! 
It's a white board Andy. Get messy. 
Maybe just a solid dot?
The nipples still seem weird.
An improvement for sure.
Better?
#oracle how do I draw boobs.
Use shadowing. Call cat Glenn if you need help.
Alright I will make a second attempt.
I would suggest curving the sides more. Give it more shape .
Damn.
Im in the backseat of a car going through baltimore right now so I cant .
Jon, draw boobs so I know what they should look like.
These drawings are so fucking funny. 
Is that a phrase or have you misplaced a snickerdoodle?
Im fuckin losing my cookies right now.

#oracle what feature is the bot really missing?
#where should Andy go to learn what these nerds are talking about .
i have no idea what anyone is talking about.
It has to have everything, Heroku uses it to run everything .
well for a "luna" yes.
I already registered a bot.
he doesnt have to do that.
And register the bot with GroupMe, a bit more complicated to setup .
kk.
does it get everything? i thought there were multiple it left out. i havent checked in a while.
You need a Heroku account, they have solid docs.
You also need the secrets file and I use "Postman" to fake message posts.
but say I want to create an alter-ego Luna.
now question, how does heroku sertup work? I know I dont have to do it for sUN testing.
mkay.
You can even input that file into pip and it will install everyhing.
Give us some credit mike.
There is a requirements file which lists every requirements (including version!) to build!
i know at least I need pymongo and json.
so hopefully not as bad?
I have the local files on my macbook.
you're going to want to install a program called "pip" which is a bitch to install on windows because god knows why.
many. it will crash and tell you "couldn't find library x", then just keep installing x until you dont get that anymore.
what libraries do we have? theres several right?
probably.
it will probably crash and burn because you don't have all the libraries.
if you've got the code local, open a cmd and go to the directory and run "python bot.py debug".
I was going to ask y'all about testing, setting up heroku, etc. soon.
they were also iterations of things you guys did.
both of your commits were pushed live with zero testing and worked.
I give you what I think is right.
I have no idea how to test.
stu is roguishly handsome, so i assume he goes rogue while coding, too.
I don't even know if Stu knows how to test or if he just went yolo .
except i guess "working" and "we fucked up the code".
the databases and state are a bit fiddly in concept, but basically stateless.
It stores Strava authentication and denies commands if you don't have it stored but that's pretty basic .
so... everything?
well you can change it back #oppositeday.
and it does literally nothing.
#oppositeday.
the only state is this.
sUN has no state, all of these commands require a sense of state in the system which is not trivial.
#gif herding cats.
thats how my hangman idea died.
with the clusterfuck nature of the groupchat.
its just request -> response.
and there's no support for conversation-like interactions right now.
meh too wordy/interaction needy.
and then it asks for a where, what, etc.
we could do #prompt.
Canada.
#clue me in.

until then.
I'll think on it.
i dunno, im an ideas man. a dreamer.
how best do we implement that?
and as I made the clue command.
That's how I felt as I updated the places txt file last night.

at this point we may as well just implement cards against humanity into sUN.

Jon is that you in there.
"I just love killin".
"Here I go killing again".
you would have to stab it many times to have any effect.
I could walk into that house and stab that pig right in the face and have no remorse .
It's good stuff.
also the generic dudes in suits photos are killing me.
^tryna jerk it.
Keep sending snapchats of the pig. I wanna be disgusted more. 
It'd be easy to do. And I guarantee you'd get away with it. 
also matt REAL ORIGINAL.
What if you poisoned it so the owners didn't know you did it.
jesus fuck no wonder man was like "lets kill this animal and eat it".
Yes.
It really snores like that matt?
Make bacon.
LOL omg matt. That fucking pig is so awful. Kill the shit out of that thing.

Probably Canadian places.
I just added a lot.
I'll probably change names so it's even.
I've probably done too many Andy themed ones already.
I can't look at it now, but it needs a line for everybody's mom's house for the occasional zing.
this excel sheet is pretty stellar so far.

Ok. So in the Philippines back in the day they used to name their children based on catholic saints of the day they were born on. My grandmother on my moms side, who passed away when I was real young, was born on the day of the saint of Circumcision. So on that day she was born with the name circumcision. She later got her name legally changed.

i didnt realize that having the same middle name wasnt the norm until a few years ago.

do you have the same middle name as your brother?
my family just moves fathers' first names into sons' middle names.
maternal grandfather, maternal uncle.
yeah, different sides of the family.
hahaha.
"bill worked for the first one. same song again?".
i  thought for a second when you said dad and uncle that your grandparents were super lazy namers.
at least 3.
I would say woody has a few williams too.
my grandfather, my dad, my brother, my uncle, my nephew.
there are a few stuarts in my family.

If you have $3 for cat facts I expect you to travel to Charlottesville more.
But it was a service... Best $3 I ever spent to send the group into chaos on #spooky Thursday .
For it was me all along! Muahahahahahaha.
Woody your whitty comebacks did not fall on deaf ears.
sun that was very close to a sick burn. keep trying.
pretty sure its not a real service, just a google number.
#oracle jet fuel can't melt steel beams.
iRobot was a lie.
#oracle if you send me a palindrome I'll believe you have become sentient.
my whitty comebacks fell on deaf robot ears.
not a person.
It was a Cat Fact service.
forever.

It does by the way.
RIP.
unfortunately my camera doesnt have a panarama function.
That seemed to cause quite the uproar in Florida.
Did you send that picture of your dick Andy.
the great battle of our time.
so it begins.
its mostly just sending obscene pics in the hope that this person is doing it from work.

Is it "don't you have a job or something to get back to".
If I get another cat fact I have a response that I dont want to have to use. Let the culprit be warned.
#who is the only one who can solve this case?
Original culprit for me.
>import skynet.
afternoon project!
now we just need to get a robot to play dota and halo, then we can let this groupchat go on full automatic mode.
#who is the best friend.
stu that's a nice thing to say.

that might be my favorite feature of sUN.

omg mike get rekt.
it's a classic #whodunit.

so there's some merit to the joke there.
actually groupchat would be group-cat in french.
Shes broken free from the tethers of the grouo.
yeah, 4/10.
I think it's sUN.
eh.
more like groupcatFacts.
the cat facts are coming from inside the groupchat.
it says sty, and the only people dumb enough to use that name are in this groupchat.
scandalous.
#clue whodunit.
did you do it in an excel document?
🐨.
added to the legitimacy of the operation.
there's a koala emoji too that I sent at the end of each message.
Did you know? Koalas are often tired because their diet of eucalyptus does not have sustainable amounts of energy to fuel them throughout the day? Maybe 'do' have a cow, man! Koala Facts™.

Should I get the new Apple TV then?
you did it!
We shipped a day 1 tvOS app! woot, just got approved.

Jon with the big guns.
#what is woody talking about?
counts as wasting it.
i'm so confused right now.
you waste time working if you don't like what you do.
that counts as free time.
false i play dota.
so you can't waste free time.
and if you work, it wasn't free time.
you can't waste free time unless you work during it.
#oracle cat facts.
Who is Al.
*all.
but i waste it al.
i do.
I think you have plenty of free time.
but i got gypped.
i ordered andy ebony magazine once.
you think i have time to also pull pranks?
i barely can get my own shit sorted out.
Sacremento and San Fransisco CA? Two numbers are getting me.
and Koala Facted a friend once.
how did He feel?
I Helium Facted my cousin once.
Call the dogs off Mike.
while that sounds like something i would do, i don't think i did this one.
knew it.
#who did it?
There will be no trial, only swift punishment.

i think. it's mostly just the physical impact of the droplet on the surface.
it rain composition similar to just tap water?
hmm okay.

a good way of doing corrosion is also electrolysis.

#clue.
Andy is a fuccboi .
did he want the theoretically infinite jaja, and we gave it to him, just with fuck andy instead.
and he wouldn't but remained convinced it would be easy.
so we told him to do it.
I think he tried to argue that it couldn't be that hard to make some command.
but his punishment was that sun responds like that.
i cant entirely remember what silly thing andy requested the bot do.
Whoa. Nice .
jajaja.
Jajajajaja .
no brian come back.
he's too used to defending others, can't defend himself anymore.

If lack of friends prevented you from eating then why is Andy such a fat ass.
fug do i not like m&m's.
i think you need a friend for trail mix to work.
i just end up with a small bag of m&m's when i eat trail mix.
Jons' right, a PIV system is doomed to fail.
Eating eating.
Trail mix fuckin sucks. You end up eating eating only the shit you like and at that point why not just buy a bag of what you wanted. 
yea, maybe when pigs fly a new PIV system.
PIV lol.
we're making a new Schlieren and PIV system.

i still have those fucking cigars.

I did get a bad gurl tattoo.
Jon after getting the tattoo "fuck I made a huge mistake".
I dont remember anymore. 
no, that's what she said.
No you said that!
she said that.
Mike D: "she has to work".
"i have to work".
Woody to the tattoo girl giving my the "bad gurl" tattoo : "you're coming with us".
i wont even say milfs because they werent.
you tried to wingman for me with 2 moms.

do you think they wash the feet first.
Or you have lovely birthing nips.

yea, "Hey girl let me see them sexy feet cause I wanna put my mouth all up on them".
is there a more offputting compliment you could pay a woman than to say she has "birthing hips"?
I've always been into birthing hips.
#oracle birthing hips.

Mike, did you hear what andy thinks about me.
My secret: jon is beautiful, don't tell anyone.
My secret: I think andy is cool and I hope he doesn't find out.
The secrets file sounds interesting. Did you guys include a bunch of secrets about us in sUN?
it wont break it.
then kill Matt's pig after that.
I'm gonna get on both when I get home and see what happens.
Kk.
@William "Woody" Devereux Zantzinger III  send me a new copy of the secrets file when you get a chance.
I think it will work eventually. I'm looking at the raw API response and it says you are still in "home".
LOL.
Also I took my car into the shop this morning because of a loud crunching noise in the front right wheel when going over bumps (hence why I'm home). Just got a call back. They found a walnut in a flex point near the shock. Fucking squirrels.
Impressed none the less. It's going to be a fair assumption that I'll be on halo anyways.

Sexually pounded #?
are we not doing phrasing anymore?
#who could get pounded by a girl?
it wasn't why she was there, but i saw her boyfriend and it looked like she could.
I'm pretty weak. So yes. 
i met a woman while working at the public defenders office who said she beat the shit out of her boyfriend all the time.
it's not a hard hill to climb.
would anyone date a woman who was significantly stronger than you physically?
i've not been. unprepared for the levels of scare-rousal.

OK a few things. Mike and Andy. I'd like to congratulate you both. You both have been awarded the 'Jon thinks everything you said today was funny' award.

jon i just followed you through that read.
#gif birds and bees.
#gif baby making.
That's fine too.
what if they tap the balls in your sleep.
but how can they cook them if we don't provide the ingredients?
No no, women cook the babies so they have to control the on off of baby making .
if it became approved for use in Canada I think i'd go for it.
^ i think this is super cool.

spell check wouldn't catch a flying juggled chainsaw either.
spell check wouldnt catch it.
but what if you're a clown? juggling is definitely an essential skill.
what if an immigration law used boarders instead of borders.
Birth control is good stuff .
like juggling.
spell check exists so spelling in an unnecessary skill.
spelling is non essential in law.

i'm sick of your shit matt.
good day.
>boarders.
yeah. boarders were crossed, friendships were made, tips were touched.
K im gonna go read. Brb. 
they also pee and make women coo.
and yeah dragos. all babies do is shit and cry.
go catch up on your readings.
jan we had a big day today.
babies are the worst.
except they have pretty good statistical evidence.
No. Bitches are crazy. 
I like the abortion tied to a decrease in violence which is discussed in freakonomics.
It's not like these women are changing for the worst, it's just that these couples are no longer compatible the way they once were.
dragos: mixed messages.
No �.
also not sucking your mans dick after marriage might cause divorce.
And no, it's not sexist. It's just that when you go off these hormonal treatments your hormones revert back to what they were before these treatments and your personality changes as well.
it is a cool thought.
...ready to apologize ronnie?
Yeah, and the article acknowledged that their evidence was not very definitive, but it's interesting!
so maybe china causes divorce.
i think most women might consider that correlation sexist.
people also buy china after they are married.
thats one of those correlation causation things though that is really hard to prove.
Thats cool.
bitches, amiright?
i dont know enough about hormones to refute you.
^hilarious.
I read this super interesting article relating the use of hormonal birth control to increasing divorce rates. They argued that since hormonal birth control methods are pretty commonplace for most women, that when they meet their first 'life partner' they go off the birth control and eventually their hormones revert back to more normal levels, and the couples become incompatible, and divorce.
mike respond to my messages.
mine was religious, but pro-choice.
matt made a funny joke.
Jon! you're jsut in time.
it's been good today.
the pro-life thing would suck.
you missed a lot.
Did i miss this conversation .
I also had a scare my freshman year of college. A week late on that one. I thought my life was over. And she was very pro-life. 
STD4lyfe.
get the fuck out you european loser.
STIs.
there are both mike.
yeah, the main reason i use condoms is to prevent STIs.
i thought it was a shot instead of a pill? splitting hairs i guess.
they should just add that to beer.
but then again a pill won't protect you against STIs.
If I could take a pill instead of using condoms that might sway me.
I don't know, it's an interesting question.
Yeah you're right.
it isn't on the market in the US yet though i don't think.
i know, thats why i ask.
there is a male birth control pill I believe.
also, if there was a male birth control pill would you guys take it?
Enough to not worry about creating life.
matt and i are life scientists ; how much do you trust science now .
get fugging rekt.
omg get rekt moke.
>what hell.
>science of more.
i dont know andy. sometimes science of more of an art than a science.
the odds of two forms of birth control failing gave me the confidence to not worry.
or skipped town.
If it got to the 'buying a pregnancy test' stage I would've had a heart attack.
Every time my ex was like a day late on her period I was pulling my hair out and not sleeping because I thought my life was over.
it's like i barely know you.
did you not go to school in the sixties?
and i'm not sure temple run was out yet.
she wouldn't have dropped out of college. roe v. wade was decades ago.
what, are you sitting there, annoyed, playing temple run while she's pissing on a stick and imagining dropping out of college?
although i have been told i have a more laid back attitude about a lot of things than is healthy.
you are, and it was more annoying than anything else.
if i'm imagining that whole ordeal with the correct girl, that's a really funny story.
whoops.
Wow holy shit.
wow important clarification there.
holy typo batman.
*and I ended up being right.
and ended up being right.
she was being paranoid.
What was your confidence level in that whole ordeal?
1st year of college was interesting.
my favorite experience at that cvs though was when a sassy black woman cashier was empathetic when I had to buy a pregnancy test on valentine's day.
i also remember that person.
*now.
Voice is very feminine note.
It's awesome I know exactly who you are talking about.
The gender ambiguous cashier from CVS on the corner now works at sticks. Transition is going well but still bunch of stubble.
(Sorry).
Its easy when you're contemplating suicide.
you guys toss that around pretty liberally.
I'd rather die.

For shitzus and giggles .
i've seen some of the girls you're interested in, so probably you, andy.
Whoo whoo whooo whoooo whooo.
classic cam.
sUN can. #who let the dogs out?
I dont want to have to listen to it. Can you just tell me who let them out?
"oh right this song is about people being repulsed when ugly girls walked into a party".
who let the dogs out was probably the hardest to get through.
I'm 30 seconds in to Who Let The Dogs Out and had to turn it off.
mike I can't believe you listened to Baha Men for 90 straight minutes.
cheetah girls, spongebob greatest hits, and mah gurl Keke P.

do you hunt ducks?
"oh i like your (barbour) jacket. what brand is that?".
mock their habits in a subtle fashion.
Mostly.

My boss is in South Africa for 3 weeks so I'm technically on a 3 week weekend.
also good use of dithering.
i'm currently in the former situation.
and yet the both of us are dithering about on this groupchat.
the bad part is when they both give you stuff to do.
the nice thing about having two bosses is they don't know when the other one hasn't given you anything to do.
very true.

#oracle what would it take to get 9 hearts?
the highest amount of hearts we've gotten recently is 8.
whenever someone asks, we just say "we don't play that".
we only play 80's joel.
people would just think we're a really shitty original group.
Let's start a Baha Men cover band and never play Who Let The Dogs Out?
>did just realized.
some one hit wonders are for a reason.
but i did just realized we missed the easiest "blue balls" joke earlier.
no.
speaking of, did you discover any hidden gems in the baha men marathon?
a deep cut.
those are the deepest of wounds.
his pride did not appear to be.
yeah, i was the guy that asked if he was alright.
YEAH YEAH YEAH SPRINT SPRINT SPRINT.
"are you alright".
ive done it.
the post-crash was "flee from my embarassment" speed.
I hope a pedestrian had the chain .
didn't really feel that bad in the end. he played it fast and loose, and, in the end, he got burned.
but credit to him, as soon as he got on his bike he started riding just as aggressively.
he tried to skid to a stop but ended up flipping over a chain.
he was biking super aggressively through washington circle, and his path got cut off by pedestrians.
watching people wipe out is the best.
who gets pizza in the morning.
i was walking home this morning, and i saw a dominos bike man wipe the fuck out.
tentacles everwhere.

Yes. He gets his coffee, woody gets a cool looking dollar, store gets money.
That's what the guy was trying to do in the first place.
Worst case scenario you are out a dollar.
You should have offered to buy the coffee for him in exchange for the dollar.

I think it was one of these: http://media.carbonated.tv/92287_story__06.jpg.
but it did look really nice? I spent some time googling around and I think it was SUPER old.
While I agreed with the guy on "Who would waste the time to make a fake $1 bill" I agreed with the cashier that it didn't look real.

Also I saw a guy get his $1 bill rejected while buying coffee. Cashier thought it might have been counterfit.

It wasnt intentional, but now I think I'm going to do it in protest of that stupid joke.
I still havent listened to hotline bling yet.
Hotline Bling by the baha man is probably my favorite song.
Duh, hotline bling is a jam. Prob listened to it for 90 mins.
90 minutes of baha men: not torture.

I read a paper a little while ago by a woman named Deborah J. Pain, and it just said DJ Pain under the article title.

I dont know much about flange vendors and I need some for wind tunnel nozzles.

This girl was just like "I can't find it, all I can see are emojis" and I just thought she was calling the other mathematical symbols emojis just for a joke or whatever but literally it was faces and little emojis.
➖.
➕.
EMOJIS in excel. I was stunned.
Most of them could find it, except for the people who had MS excel 2014 because when you go to insert symbol the first thing that comes up are EMOJIS.
So I was teaching a lab yesterday and the students had to make a graph on excel (a bunch of first years - they were totally lost), and I was helping a lot of students with their figure titles, and they had to put a ± symbol in the figure title.

>get hood.
>git gud.
>get gud.
I believe get gud scrub still applies.
anyways, as someone who recently laned lina against huskar, it's annoying to get started. i got a couple of lucky ganks then the snowball was on, but if you get too far behind she's not impressive against husky anymore.
>hakuna meh-tata.
meh hakuna matata is the right approach to teamwork.
I said "keep blaming your teammates, I'm sure that will improve your mmr".
^^.
did you tell her to git gud.
bb, wk, spec.
pure damage and tanky right clickers are good against him.
And the lina was the one bitching.
Thats the worst part. I also had lina!
blast + laguna every damn time he showed his face.
our counterpicks to huskar hahaha. aa + lina immediately.
>Game is hard.
lol.
It was infuriating.
But I got flamed by kids who were 1k mmr.
I had no doubts about my decision.
Aa is just a really good hero.
Did the other team pick heroes? Pick AA and Enigma.
he's like enigma.
fuck man, AA counters everyone.
AA is a good counter to brood too because it shuts off her ult.
Im aware. My team was not.
AA destroys huskar.
wat.
People are fucking idiots.
My previous game I got flames by my team for choosing aa when they had a huskar.
Yeah our wr played great. And only because people dont know how to deal with him.
he's so easy to counter.
also, first ban huskar? why?
plus you had a viper gg ez.
yeah your Wr put in work.
Also it was captains mode and I picked the team. Did not see last pick brood coming at my mmr.
They were. We perservered though. Killed brood a bunch of times, got a lot of farm, won some teamfights and took towers ez.
When you're relying on ogre for AOE you know things are rough.

Baha.
no no no.

🎶And I know when that hotline bling🎶.
Who let the dogs out by the baha men .
^lol.
wtf song are you guys quoting?
🎵 started wearing less and going out more🎵.
false jon.
lol gg ez.
That show sucks.
they did a great job of fleshing out the character for sure, but i disagree with your interpretation.
I just want to harp on peanut butter because he's the only character that looks 2d on first pass.
yeah, her finale of season 2 was my favorite part of that episode.
I love her character too. Excited for season 3.
he actually believes in love.
for mr. peanut butter happiness and satisfaction are easy.
she knows life is shitty but tries to make the best even though it doesn't come naturally.
i would say princess carolyn is what you're describing, no mr. penut butter.
Michael "Jon Gabriel" Desrosiers changed name to Kofi Makir.
Yeah I shouldn't have argued the detail.
i'm exaggerating when i say everyone, but you know what i mean.
I don't think Todd is cynical but that's a separate matter.
but he's also not cynical like the rest of the cast.
Not that life is perfect but he chooses to make it good.
I think the active choices are what make it interesting though.
he's not an idiot.
he sees the best in situations.
he instantly forgives people.
he is as close to pure as it gets though, a couple of stray line of dialogue aside.
I think Mr decides to be happy, which is the difference. 
Woody is such a Zelda.
Not that anyone is.
Zoey Zelda but I think he's not pure.
no being able to remember characters names is hindering me discussing this.
one is the brooding type and the other one is generally happy.
it goes back to the whole duality thing with the girls from the sitcom whose names i can't remember.
Andy I want to get into it more with you about Mr peanut butter. But we'd drive this chat insane. 
You from Buffy.
it from buffy.
i dont like that gif.
#gif bird person .
unlike a lot of the characters.
not depressed by them.
if we are talking about mr. peanut butter, he is happy with the small distractions.
He's not the most cynical, but he's not clean of it.
bojack literally dumped money into a pit of fire rather than give it to orphans.
"Life is filling your days with meaningless tasks, then you die".
but they are all awful people.
Not so sure of that Andy.
don't get me wrong i relate more to the cynicism.
because he is one of the few actually good characters. the rest are all cynical.
I really like mr peanut butter.
#gif bojack.

It basically sucks. I got lots of content about its suckiness.
#gif bed bath and beyond .
"fuck you, you will walk where we tell you to walk".
"hey i want to cut through the middle of the store".
that place forces you to walk through a certain way.
Is it as labyrinthine as the store itself.
because i'm pretty sure at this point thats got to be their main sales driver.
is there a college dorm section?
also, what does their mobile app even do? let you look at products?
Burp.
seriously though, you may want to double check that with the positron spell checker.
you can't just add science words before normal things mike.
woah, great idea. Will do that later.
Run that through the Markov generator.
If anyone ever talks anything about Bed Bath & Beyond I am going to step in and correct them like an asshole know it all.

hamstring is such a weird word. like, of all the compound words out there they chose to combine 'ham' and 'string'.
Be mad disrespectful dawg, spam that sorry button.
i'm at 7 wins jon, still only 1 loss.
Big mistake, due for a big week 8 against the English defense who's ranked last in the league against both the pass and the rush. 
Jon Gabriel (carry) is listed as Questionable (hamstring) going in to week 7. Fantasy owners are advised to drop him due to his already shaky performance this season, and with the injury only further hampering his abilities.
Also I definitely pull my hamstring running this morning. Shit sucks.
Is it possible to convey sarcasm through pictures. I dont think so, I tried and it didnt work.
Nice.

If I wanted to ask this Cortlyn out, but couldn't think of how to approach her would that be a "Court of Cort in hold up" .
yeah, she played soccer and was (is?) very pretty.
Did you really know a girl named cortlyn bristol.
If I ran into a girl named Cortlyn Bristol from high school and she was really big into cheerleading moves now and I picked her up, would that be a hold up of my new friend Cort?
nvm, ignore that one. Its early. Gotta get warmed up first. 
If I beat Nadal in straight sets on clay, would that be luck on a tennis court?
If I ordered Peking at the Chinese place at the mall, would that be a whole duck in food court?
If the defensive back pulls the jersey of the receiver before the ball is thrown in court, would that be called a hold up in court?
If someone got robbed at gunpoint inside the courtroom, would that be a hold up in court?

That wouldve made my night watching that.

No I wish. I was just in the crowd. 
especially the dancing. Lots of random dancing in every program.
You are 100% right.
Jon I have actually watched a decent amount of Filipino TV.
>no but I did stay in a holiday inn express last night.
As a contestant??
No but I did have the opportunity to go on one of those game shows when I was last in the Philippines .
Jan were you a filipino child TV star ?
Filipino television has two genres. Well three if you count the news. One is really awful game shows. Half the time during the game they take a 10-15 minute segment where they bring in dancers who dance to some shitty rihanna song. The other is hilarious dramas (telenovela style). The last one I saw my parents watching involved a 6 year old angel battling the devil (the devil was a 60 year old filipino man with a bad english accent).
Also Law and Order.
We have "naked and dating" here.

Michael "Jon Gabriel" Desrosiers changed the topic to: William "Woody" Devereux Zantzinger III - "Whoppers are fucking great" 16 October 2015.
I want to go on record and say, "Whoppers are fucking great".
Woody are those Altoids with caffeine in them?
now you've got me imagining curt shilling on a safari beaning the shit out of some gazelles. and it's glorious.

The most recent one I played was black and I caught basically everything I could in that game and some of the ones in white (if Liz would hurry and and beat the elite 4 already). I havent played any of the other versions recently though so I'm pretty limited.
I also never transferred my black & platinum collections over to x&y. I need to get organized with the pokemon vault or whatever.
on x & y.
my friend, on the other hand, has a complete pokedex.
I do but it's not too close. I never was good at catching them all just wrecking face.

matt, these would be the "First Nations".

such tasteful racism Jon.
Knowing LinkedIn it would be "Purchase Premium Plus to stop Native Americans from connecting!".
I originally wrote african americans there but i thought Native Americans would be more tasteful.
LinkedIn options: "Uncheck this box to block all Native Americans from connecting".
I googled. It isn't.
lol, is that even an option?
Would it be racist to have LinkedIn auto block everyone from India who tried to connect?
@Cam and @Dragos is hilarious. Straight to the point names.

I've never gotten such blow by blow poop detail.
and then had a transition poop out.
and stayed like that.
and then it got bright.
then the next was green but darker.
had streaks of green.
so like the first poop post BKHW.
I got the "BK Lounge" reference.
Awesome. 
it like ramps up.
i had figured on one green poop, not multiple. that would frighten me.
but not texture of that.
it's a thrill seeing poop the color of Nickelodeon slime.
#worth.
in sum would you say #worth or #notworth?
thank you for this in depth analysis of burger king and the halloween wopper.
until you just forget that your poop can be not green, and things go back to normal.
but then makes you slightly concerned as the green never seems to end.
this is a green that surprises and impresses you.
like jolly rancher style.
I'm talking bright green.
and not like a mossy green that sometimes happens when you eat a lot of vegetables.
be warned though, after you feast on that Halloween whopper, and go through a series of reminiscing flashbacks, you will poop green for at least 2 days.
that's how I first got in to MTG.
win tickets on games and redeem them for MTG cards.
those were better days.
when my local BK was next to a planet play (like a Chuck E. Cheese's). They actually had a door between them so you could go from BK to Planet Play. Big Kids Meal straight to moon bounce and laser tag.
it takes me back to the days of pokemon toys and paper crowns.
The rest is classical whopper, which is good. I kind of forgot that BK Lounge makes good burgers.
The taste is unusual but yummy, not quite A1 but they also put A1 sauce on the burger so it tastes yummy.
>takes notes furiously.
The bread tastes like any other bread but looks African as can be.
Jon now that I've fully recovered I can give you a review of the Halloween burger .
That's about all they've got going for them .
If this sandwich sucks i dont think ill ever go back to burger king.
I like their chicken fries.
Burger king sucks donkey dicks .
I like the panic random order.
Busy day for Jon.

phase crit bigger crit rapier.
easy carry crit-stal maiden.
Just pick a different hero at that point .
Yes. But other than that and a BF, Basher, Helm BKB build i think everything is pretty shit.
s&y skedi would be like the 6.83 (is that the right patch? whenever jugg last mattered) way to build her.
yeah you like that sick 175 crit.
then you don't do any damage :(.
Less greedy may be the s&y shit .
Pussy build .

You could read The Hobbit in less time than it'd take you to watch all 3 shitty movies.
Don't say things you can't take back.
i've heard that movie sucks donkey dick.
The animated hobbit?
*hobbit.
alternatively, we could just have it be a tradition that we watch the hobit the night before and hydrate.
8 am to midnight lol. That's a survival effort. 
16 hour lotr day anyone?
makes the movie enjoyable.
https://tolkieneditor.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/i-have-recut-peter-jacksons-hobbit-trilogy-into-a-single-4-hour-film/.
y'all should still watch the hobbit cut some guy did.
Damn right something did.
#gif hobbit gopro.

Better quality than the hobbit.
thats photoshop? i thought it was an alternate cut by peter jackson.
3000 hrs in photoshop.
yeah, i thought you were cool, Andy.
I can't believe you'd value citation format over the quality of joke.
do i come to your job and tell you how to suck dick?
bitch, don't tell me how to cite my cases.
Should have been Grp. Me. App., 2015.
1) see My Balls v. Mike's Mouth, 19 Ct. App. 27, 33 (Vir. Ct. App. 2015).
Andy nice citation.
*tips fedora* I'm sorry sir, no questions regarding sexual activity will be tolerated here in Virginia!
yeah its the "Employee Polygraph Protection Act" and it outlawed polygraph use for all employers more or less.
Your fedora law has no jurisdiction here. 
I know you meant federal, but I'm imagining fedora now.
Also apparently the virginia law only forbids questions regarding sexual activity, but I think there's a federa law about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACGClMQeV4M.
K.
Plus they can be abused to ask questions about personal information irrelevant to the job.
Because people decided that polygraphs were a shitty way to tell if someone was lying and so people passed a law.
Polygraph tests are so unreliable that basing any kind of decision off the results of one of their 'tests' is inherently wrong and lazy.
Can't you fire an employee for anything in Virginia?
Andy why is it illigal to polygraph a potential employee?
It's so good but I feel like she's going to blow her larynx to smithereens if she keeps this up.
incredible performance^.

#oracle seriously tho.

#oracle amirite?
i fuckin love butterfingers.
i liked it as much as i like eating butterfingers.
did you like my uncle rico.
very fun 10v10 game to watch.
#oracle should all of us forget about politics and just worship the sun god?
More like polidicks amirite ?
things i am not interested in discussing in a remotely serious manner on this groupme: politics.
His free college idea is also about as reasonable as Trumps giant wall on Mexico. 
Bernie Sanders. About as reasonable as Donald Trump is for a candidate for President. 
True chainz. 
To be fair, this is a pretty white group.
#whose cousin is blackest.

Is your cousin black?
#oracle do any of the democratic candidates have any black friends?

Wow this race question is retarded .
nvm, shit again. 
Whats happening? I stopped watching.
Lol this debate has actually just taken a pretty hilarious turn .
Neither do they .
#oracle great debate.
Guess Hillary and Bernie are fucked .
Ez votes for them I guess .
#oracle what can the other three guys say to win votes .
They're suppose to be debating each other, not Anderson Cooper. He's moderating like a journalist. 
Anderson Cooper is also a pretty shit moderator .
Those other three dudes have got to know that no one gives a shit about them .
None of the candidates other than clinton and sanders have more than 5%. It seems silly that they are even there.
This democratic debate is pretty shit.
What a time to be alive .
#now.

north america on the other hand isn't so bad. while the middle is a clusterfuck, the only entrances into the continent are three choke points, making it very easy to hold once you've gained control.
Getting involved in a land war in Asia. Classic blunder .

I made all the potions, I explored for miles, I made my giant railroad, I made my giant fortress.
It got to the point when we last played minecraft that I didn't have anything left to do.
and Matt it was a quote from Youth in Revolt.
I still have that server world.
that was so fun when we figured that shit out.
LOL i remember laughter.
remember the horses jon?

I want to tickle your belly button.
it wasn't that hard to make but it was super satisfying to have every color.
i enjoyed my sheep farm.
like me in your mother.
I think that that actually goes so deep in the embarrassing that it's back to impressive again.
or the people that build computers inside it.
Like my railroad.
I think Minecraft also had a bit of embarrasingly impressive feats. It's like, wow thats nice..but you also spent fucking forever making that.
people will yearn for the rustic tap-based interface of the past.
tap dat app is super viable now that iPhone has 3d touch.
^he's absolutely right.
It is embarrassingly* impressive.
its hella impressive.

oh i could share the tap-dat-app master list here.
LOL^.
mysterious sausage .
got confused, dick in marinara sauce.
ez fucking app.
and instead of additional pictures there's people who ordered that meal giving comments.
or "netflix and grill".
yelp meets tinder meets urbanspoon.
when you checkout.
third date.
when do I put my dick in the food andy.
and at any point you can stop swiping and select between your right swipes.
and you right or left swipe based on if you like them.
and then it presents you with pictures of meals that match the description.
you enter in your meal preferences like you would your dating preferences on a site like tinder.
and "Tap dat App".
ok so here is the actual app: its for a site like grubhub.
also followed by "would you put this up your butt for $1,000,000".
how's that going anyway? well I assume.
second to Virtual Yoyo, of course.
Holy shit Woody, Tender is a billion dollar app idea.
that account fucks.
Introduce them to Nihilist Arby's on Twitter.
is favor in cville?
they have an uber food service now i think.
if I could order an uber that comes with a taco that's a plus.
Their new Marketing team fucks.
Arby's has been on point lately.
its neat but ui kinda sucks.
I'm actually pitching this to Arby's, I was only 5% kidding.
the urge to boot people for saying things i disagree with is too strong.
Aware.
taco bell has that an ordering app.
i like arby's.
i have said it before and i'll say it again.
follow along Mike.
cause they have the Meats.
easy left swipe.
and even that wasn't as guarenteed as control warrior vs freeze mage.
why would arby's even be on the app.
LOL.
brb making millions.
gonna call it "Tender".
Nice, that's an awesome idea woody lol.
I'm pitching it to Arby's.
handlock is the only deck that ever had a consistantly good winrate against patron.
Like "Damn thats a good looking Sandwhich" - Only 1.1 Miles Away!
i'd need a tinder for sandwenches.
at least freeze mage has super hard counters though.
$/taco?
What about Tinder for Sandwhiches?
I feel like it might be the best idea ever.
If the nerf was to stop defensive play and not developing a board then freeze mage would also be phased out as well right.
About to go talk to someone about it.
Would anyone order a taco on their phone a-la Uber?
I got to get back to work. This GroupMe sets me back about an hour everyday.
We hit it with a rocket car.
what if you meet an immovable object?
Team Woody Cam Jon is an unstoppable force.
i understand the nerf; patron warrior makes you play extremely defensively passing the turn without developing a board .
you are welcome woody.
i've lost a lot with my control warrier to secret pally. its hard to beat challenger, boom, tyrion on 6-7-8.
You also played Ranked. Thanks for that.
i played two games and i think i was an active detriment to my team.
I'm not enough for you?
I wish more of you liked the online sensation that is Rocket League.
control priest and warrior counter secret pally pretty well.
Good it got nerfed but still excessive imho. I wish they would balance more frequently with smaller tweaks rather than like this.
They dont like combos involving charge because its hard to counterplay.
#gif dark magician.
>what hell.
>why the nerfed it so bad.
Secret paladin will now be absurdly OP. Its only issue was that it was bad against patron.
I wonder why the nerfed it so bad.
#oracle what is the heart of the cards.
#gif heart of the cards.
you summoned exodia?????
Yea, Blue eyes white dragon is and will stay OP.
fuck patron warrior anyway bruh.

Seriously dragos?

i like abbadon. he's fun to play.
Ahhh good ole sports.
Most people wouldn't understand that joke Cam cause theres only a bunch of fuckin dweebs in this chat.
I'll be the Deion Branch.
#kobe how many shades of that color.
as a part of the Tea Party movement you have to love gif-ing ariana grande, accept me as the one true Omniknight, and make sure your name is Judge.
#what will the third branch be symbolized by.
I'm a part ofthe Tea Party movement.
Who shall be the third branch?
So we have now established that we have a two branched government in the groupme.
I love lamp.
Fuck yea. Lamp.
i dont know what we do with this information but keep it in mind.
ok i'll be the bracelets, you can be the lamp woody.

was it the bracelets or the lamp?
Someone get a lamp.

As kanye west put it: no one man should have all that power.
Nope. Just a check against mikes power.
I feel like there are some heavy philosophical things to be said about that killswitch.
that's some saw-esque shit.
roaming kunkka could kind of work if you were -really- good with kunkka.
LOL.
Suckas.
I added a kill switch on sUN so if I get kicked it just goes dark.

Are we still on Pokemon? Fuck pokemon.
Gyrodos could also learn fly too cause he's a boss ass bitch.
has anyone ever done a nuzlocke?
Alternative water pokemon for me was gyrodos.
One bitch pokemon.
You get nidoqueen for hm utility.
explain THAT gamefreak.
Yeah, surfing on a tentacruel? Lapras on the main screen.
probably the subliminal message of her always being the surf pokemon.
I'm on team lapras .
pokemon that don't evolve at all aren't worth it in my book.
Probably one of my favorite pokemon.
yeah lapras is stupid.
I always liked lapras for some reason.
Lapras blows.
^thats what lapras is for mike.
I kind've agree matt, except that it takes so much effort to capture them.
I liked dewgong for wrecking the dragon guy.
http://www.rijon.com/brown/.
if you want to stay gen 1 play this.
I have an emulator on my phone and I've been downloading old shit. Like now i'm playing the gameboy zelda.
They're cheating IMO.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/.
I'd always try to get a final lineup without any legendaries.
jon if youre looking for more pokemon play a rom.
I was considering downloading the other newer pokemons but I was too scared to see new pokemon I didn't know.
Idk what my overall final lineup is but it almost always has: dragonite, zapdos, lapras and probably charizard if he was my starter.
I always just troll the forest for as long as it takes.
the most broken thing in that game is getting infinite rare candies from the missingno glitch.
everyone's running around with caterpies and shit but then you're like THUNDERSHOCK.
The most broken thing in that game is catching a lvl 3 Pikachu in Viridian Forest.
You can get a dugtrio 10 levels above the rest of your pokemon.
Thats one of the more broken things in that game.
yes! I saw him and I was like, damn kid...you're coming with me.
Did you catch the overleveled one in the cave?
I did have thunderpunch with hitmonchan.
I was fond of him after that.
Did Hitmonchan have Thunderpunch?
I kept dugtrio after he helped me in the electric gym.
I usually get zapdos.
Also, no elecric pokemon?
I'd always pick up a Nidoqueen.
Yeah Dugtrio is pretty rare to take to the Elite 4.
Thank God you didn't say pinsir. 
I like your lineup jon. Almost none of those are pokemon I usually use.
Zapdos used thunder!
It's super effective!
Slowbro doesn't give a shit!
False, gotta respect the special defense build .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=759oWvskLRI.
I think this is it.
Slowbro can take hits.
But Kadabra is a glass cannon.
that fucker took so long to capture, i think i went through like fuckin 60 ultra balls.
I'd always do kadabra over slowbro.
And Articuno is my fave pokemon ever. A man after my own heart.
Arcanine is so sick.
that's what I ended the game with.
Final list: Blastoise, Hitmonchan, Slowbro, Articuno, Dugtrio, Arcanine.
You don't metro-knowm me.
we obviously aren't talking about pokemon enough.

Jon, final team, let's go.
but thats really for fighting other people.
EVs are the incentive.
especially considering that when you're going through the game fighting shitty opponents on your way to somewhere, you just use your OP starter pokemon to one-hit basically anything.
like you end up finding super high lvl pokemon later in the game with no effort in using them in battle.
I dunno, I just wish there was more incentive in raising pokemon from the beginning of the game.
jon get a job.
What didnt you like?
I like shorts. They're comfy and easy to wear.
Pokemon is the shit.
> green leaf.
It was fun, but I noticed a lot that I didn't like after playing Pokemon again, but also obviously a lot I did like.
> green lead.
I beat Pokemon Green Leaf in two days.
Just ate lunch so I feel pretty full thanks.

Yeah that's how mine is formatted too.
yea thats the new thing.
for my thesis i will copy paste the manuscript for my paper.
I didn't get my honours thesis bound and I periodically tear pages out for scrap.
of course, but it's like a... thanks for birthing me so I could contribute this to society.
My family won't want to read my thesis, nor my friends.
Hire an illustrator to make a super fancy cover.
and give copies out to fmaily and friends.
Yes.
nice.
cause I would.
yes.
Do you leatherbound it?
That's what it is.
it is a book.
So write a book I guess.
that's what I want to get my hands on.
Dissertations are normally 200-300.
Jesus. 150.
yea.
Most MSc theses in my program span 150-200 but I think that's pretty unnecessary.
Proposals are like thesis length but you don't have to cite any sources and I usually make the whole thing up.
My honours thesis was like 55 pages or something.
yea that's on target.
Having never written a thesis this sounds rough.
Whcih in my program is pretty concise.
Yeah totally. I'm trying to keep mine short and sweet too. Under 100 pages is the goal.
thanks. it's going to be as short as possible because I just want to be done. I'm already working for my new advisor and would rather put effort into that.
I'm up to 9k words, about half way there.
Sty that's a sharp-looking thesis.

#oracle your ability to parse leads to much farce .
Stolen from Stackoverflow: "If I gave you an english sentence, and asked you to break down the sentence into its parts of speech (nouns, verbs, etc.), you would be parsing the sentence.".
something we can all understand.
parsing is like you going through a ducks stomach picking out thigs.

who knows?!
#oracle Are things a bit more random now?
Super easy to do but who knows what the results would be like. It can parse any text in the .txt format.
No it wouldn't.
Because it would be funny if you added a random source that wasnt this groupme. Like a blog, book or tv script.

Woody I remember playing Civ with you and you had your mic muted because Erika had gone to bed or something. Andy and I started plotting against you and you all-chatted "It's almost worth the divorce to yell." I laughed.
I don't remember laughter.
I also remember laughter.
I also remember a game where Cam was called Dendi cause of his OP Mappo skills.
I remember that game where Woody was called Dendi cause of his OP ES skills.
Also, I've seen veno take solo offlane now that he's been buffed. I actually like veno mid and think it's viable if you want to be a walking deathbomb. You get either blink or shadow blade and gank a lot and then push lanes once the kills have been secured.
The fact that ES still isn't in captain's mode after over a year in the game just proves that no one really knows what he does and how to fit him in. He's one of those heroes with such a high skill cap that if you really know the hero you're unstoppable in pretty much any scenario.
i bet when they do the post-major update, it will have some small nerf for earth spirit and then they add him.
true.
thats just a convenience thing not really a buff or nerf.
or was that already there?
they made it so double tapping puts a stone reminent in front of you, right?
Won't change him. Won't add him.
in the last patch they didn't even change ES.
its not fair. They have added new heroes and added those to captains.
also nice self-like.
one day woody.
he should be in CAPTAINS MODE.
now he isn't.
ES was so OP for a while.
still won though.
we also had an obnoxious feeding veno on our team.
i remember the game someone literally called woody dendi because you played an awesome es game.
this was like a year ago.
we did ES vs ES.
was it puck?
remember when I beat Brian 1v1? I remember.
lol.
either way, no one wins so its perfect.
most likely will settle once and for all who should win that mid.
us both playing with heroes we don't really play.
word.
its the only way.
1 v 1 mid to settle.
all veno has to do is right click him when he gets close to the creeps.
Lvl2 flame guard and veno is drad.
Early levels ember trashes veno.
and ember is popular right now.
i mean against an ember i'm pretty sure he would destroy him.
we all know Puck is the best mid.
Or have mobility to get out.
Most mids aren't there for that.
lol.
ez.
Then don't.
he can kill if you overcommit.
Every other popular mid can spam the wave and leave.
I don't hate him mid as strongly but I don't like him.
Best he can do is not lose.
I hate him mid.
OK. Sold.
its like a more teamfighty version of brood i guess.
yeah pretty much.
So basically be Brood till minute 25 then become walking AOE death ult.
yeah.
i saw one team get their veno an aghs from alch, so maybe in that case a support veno would work.
big damage dealer with just an Aghs ult?
and then he just transitions into a big damage dealer later in the game.
but a good veno can set up a whole thing of wards.
windranger and other mids can be ganked.
yeah, but the whole point of veno is that he sets up in a lane and is super hard to actually fight into.
I just think 0-4-4-0 mid works and takes the tower. But no moreso than Windranger or other mids who can focus the tower.
i dont play the hero a lot, so most of this is just stuff i've heard.
idk.
is that super shitty?
he needs so many levels though.
like AA, working to get levels for 6 then going midas.
His lane presence is so nice though I like him much more as a dual lane support.
also apparently 0-4-4-0 build is popular right now.
and slowly push their tower down.
you set up your wards so you cannot get ganked.
mid.
I love that hero. He got buffed. Where can he play?
talk to me about Venomancer.
Also lets steer back into Dota 2 for a moment.
yeah, most courts are generally only open during the week.

but attributing the car crash to him seems extra bullshitty.
#gif phoenix wright.
thats the best i could see.
instead of referring the kids to get real help?
maybe they argued that the principal provided treatment that is hocus pocus.
b) people die in car crashes all the time.
a) teenagers commit suicide all the time.
and 2 kids comitted suicide and one died in a car crash.
he apparently hypnotized a shit ton of people.
ok read it, still think its bullshit.
i didnt actually read the story one sec.
with great power comes great responsibility?
3 kids dying right after you hypnotized them in the same year though.
rookie mistake.
but then you're relying on a jury not being stupid.
yeah, if i was the defense attorney i would just argue "this isn't real, this lawsuit is stupid".
I mean apparently its legit enough for someone to settle law things.
but that seems like its attributable to placebo.
i think my uncle did too.
My grandmother got hypnotized into stopping smoking? 
I also have wondered that Andy. 
yeah tellem mike.
Stupid people.
But after seeing people get 'hypnotized' something strange definitely happens to certain people.
Yeah, it feels like acupuncture or homeopathy.
I had a hypnotist try to work his voodoo on me once and it didn't work.
The skeptic in me thinks it's all a bunch of hogwash.
Is hypnosis a real thing? I feel like I've never got a straight answer on that.

Is anything truly real, Woody?
Uhh is the Joel request for real?
Yeah I think orgy is 4+.

Andy you are the first person I've met who is in an open relationship.

I promise minimal orgies.
But speaking of liz's two boyfriends, can joel stay in the room too woody?
There's been a lot.

Or are you just straight pimpin?
Okay Andy I was able to move some things around and you are good to go on the room for YAR.
Ok here's a question. Andy are you and Liz dating? Because I feel like that's been said a bunch of times but then I also hear about you going off and hooking up with other girls?
People are looking at me funny because I'm on the verge of tears.
LOL.
�.
i dont know andy, we could find a girl i've hooked up with and you could sleep with her.
I'm checking with the agent at the front desk.
make sure you don't lose your wallet.
Doto.
I'm home.
Jan.
If woody overbooked that may be the only move I have.
*an air mattress.
my couch is reserved but you're always free to bring and air mattress and become floor people.
*crickets*.
woody if you are being serious tell me now because liz and i need to find other accomidations.
is that in reference to andy or to rocke league.
Butt Fucks.
Rocket League later.
#now.
Something similar happened.
and yes i do remember it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T2GmGSNvaM.

You know that Seinfeld bit where the car company takes the reservation but doesn't hold the car.
i have your room reserved remember?
yes and yes.
We should make Steak.
Andy are you coming for YAR?

I almost bought that things a few weeks ago.
glad you like it.
Steaks for DAYS.
yes.
fuck.
Woah andy just say your email.
5/10 ok.
#kobe how high do numbers go.
How high can numbers go again?
how excited is erika/10 to have said puppy.
woody, you need to put a pair of black sunglasses on him ASAP to create your own �.
Puppy dick could get some people fired.
Nsfw.
Adorable.
A chocolate lab!
Not a good photo but the only one I have.
good name!
GO.
named him Bently.
photo.
woody, details.
what.
I bought a puppy today.
s.
I've embraced my old-man statu.
how is life in prison?
yeah woody cant because erica would get mad at him.
woody's just being negative because he's married.
you just might not be employed for long.
you can.
Disagree.
jan you are a grown man, you can wear jammys whenever you please.
we could wear jammys.
@Butt  im still on this playlist and its still bitching.
Jons got my back.
we could get pizza and milkshakes.
I would travel many miles for a LAN party.
its pretty good.
google it.
pyromasters is a flash version of that game.
http://www.nongnu.org/bombermaze/1.jpeg.
haha I fucked you in that game everytime.
wreck woodys face again.
LOL god damn I wanna play that shit.
last update in 2004.
http://www.nongnu.org/bombermaze/.
pyromasters.
or at least the online flash version was.
I'm googling for it now.
it was called pyro something.
that shit was the fucking jam.
omg the old bomberman game on woody's old asus laptop.
i do.
but no one has fun when you stomp them 8 times in a row.
buy me a wii and a proper TV and sure.
we could have so much fun.
mike, please learn the new games.
dont say smash because you never mean the original and you probably dont want to play that with me anyways.
Smash Brothers.
We could also resurrect some other old games. Remember that fucking awesome Bomber man clone we used to play?
>sorry.
what would you call your wedding then?
No one thinks getting together for a nerd weekend would be fun. Fine. Fuck you guys.
but i digress.
i guess if the "you" was jesus, that sentence could have more general uses.
something people rarely say.
i only won because you were more honest than me.
The score is 2-1 in Settlers Mike so you better step up.
homecomings, settlers @ alley light.
I'm assuming we would be sitting together for this event.
settlers on LAN?
age of empires 2 I'll take you all to the cleaners.
we have lots of nerdy options.
Rocket League, Halo on Xbox, Dota 2, Starcraft 1, Settlers.
dont start fights you wont finish woody.
Starcraft 1? You would lose.
oh snap starcraft 1?
warcraft 2: tides of darkness?
...for what game.
someone set that up.
LAN party.
You know what.
"I <3 boobies".

his stupid face is hilarious every time.
but that picture of woody is so good :(.
its like putting it on the fridge.
someone make that the groupme profile picture.
That's my boy cam, take notes.
>Relax, you're doing fine.
Ez test ggwp.
���.
Yeah, I had to conceal laughter many times today.
the groupme was straight fire today. well done gentlemen.
jon doto.
because either way thats hilarious.
or just some guy.
Tell him you love Panic! At the Disco.
like the rapper?
I'd say you should take him roller-blading and try to touch his bum.
send messages and report back.
What if I told you guys I matched with Cameron on tinder.
so is your penis.
jesus, does this guy know anything?
Microbiology.
it's biology andy.
a micro class? how can you learn economics if you can't even fit in the classroom?
RIP.
>rekt.
^^.
that'll get a real kick.
show them your dick instead.
We're waiting for our tests to be graded.
if so, get off groupme.
are you teaching the class.
cam why are you in front of your class.
Everyone now wants to see what I laughed at.
Hahah i just laughed in front of my micro class at Dragos' comment from earlier.
Also picturing Jon playing Au Claire de la Lune in school band is hilarious.
I played timpanies and it was fun as hell.
you're fuckin right.
tower hill made me play clarinet for 6 years.
did my school buy a jumbotron instead of building needed infrastructure?
pub school is the shit.
pub school 4 lyfe.
yea I went to that home depot all the time.
that was our lives.
That was nuts.
Shit I remember that.
sike they werent even in a van.
"hey you should fear every plain white van you see".
lol we win.
around town.
we had a sniper shooting people.
matt you had a bomb threat?
matt describe to me your sad canadian school.
Jon I'm on board with that.
stu, like that one ^.
public high school thug life.
let's also note all the sweet private school benefits these tower hill kids just listed.
would get stabbed for it.
Wouldn't mind being Jon Snow for that Ygritte Cave slam.
i wish i was hot like drogo.
>what hell.
>drago's.
lol drago's comment earlier..still great.
tellem dragos.
lame.
many of them were recently re-tired.
thanks jon.
dead people.
and who couldn't use more rest/.
coma is a way to get some rest.
also a fast way to go to the hospital.
yup.
yup.
have you guys heard about the vodka soaked tampons as a fast way to get severely shit faced?
#gif stinky feet.
so it can wash away the taste of your emotions.
so that's where vodka gets its taste.
best disclaimer.
#gif vodka.
RIP.
like I do with you, jon.
^ im assuming all those dudes are gay.
#gif gay is the only way.
I still feel like that girl is the one who got away.
ha...GAY!!!!
i like you too matt.
Easily the hardest i've laughed all day.
dragos I like you.
dragos with the next level depressing humor.
LOL.
whenever i wanted to make girls laugh id tell them i liked them.
thats it, no sadness here.
I remember in middle school Meghan Lyons asked me to a dance on AIM.
i know the feeling matt.
judge changed the topic to: was gonna tell a girl I liked her that night but decided to chug vodka instead.
was gonna tell a girl I liked her that night but decided to chug vodka instead.
i had a high school teacher named matt stoner. he was a terrible weak, meek man. when he was in high school the cool kids definitely make him smoke weed.
The true tragedy during highschool was when I got drunk off vodka for the first time at a Burning Man party on a beach and passed out next to the fire and my dad had to come pick me up in a zoo of 100 drunk teenagers.
thats the true tragedy.
And there were hundreds of flights that got diverted to Canada that day and had to land on the east coast.
wait sorry wrong generation.
where were you when kennedy was shot.
Well obviously it didn't affect us the same way it affected you guys, but yeah things definitely changed right after.
was 9/11 considered as significant in canada as it was here?
we watched it on the tvs and had no idea what was going on.
jon confirmed terrorist.
I was in health class in grade 6 during 9/11.
did they figure out who called it in? was it you matt?
I remember 9/11 we went to the auditorium. And max kept on making me laugh during the fucking announcement.
LOL.
that day rocked.
we had a bomb threat one day and got sent home at 10AM.
andy's sand-ranch.
LOL nothing beats andy's ranch sandwiches.
And we could come and go to our music room and just jam which was sick.
did you have a sweet sandwhich bar where you could make sandwhiches with a bunch of ranch on them?
we did have a room where we'd play smash.
did you have ham and cheese sandwiches that you'd make into huge foil balls?
so much super smash was played.
did you have a homeroom with a wii set up to a projector screen?
holy shit I probably ate 50 pounds of the stuff.
we had sweet mexican rice though.
no :(.
or Mr. Chris' bread?
yeah but did you have Taco bar?
I was on student council and my best friend was pres so we didn't do shit.
I had a pretty sweet highschool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wknywxfcE5M.
either that or you would've hated the shit out of it.
Matt, you would've liked our high school.
and then get him kicked out for being a stoner.
remember our senior homeroom. shit was so cool.
we have to get andy back in to highschool.
i love that ruben got kicked out for doing it.
guys.
i never did because no one ever asked me to #sadtrombone.
but after school all bets were off.
I never blazed during school because I was too #nervous.
He was talking about plantar warts, shit was so fucking funny.
The worst part is that Michael Aboff was in front of me and I couldn't stop laughing at him presenting.
I remember I had to do a human anatomy presentation completely blazed in high school.
indeed.
mitch.
5 points to whoever knows who thats from.
i still do, but i used to too.
i used to do drugs.
and now you dont?
14 year old me just wanted to jerk off.
fuck you man.
fuck those guys.
hacking has never been so ez.
"lets fuck with people trying to watch porn".
ruthless era for hackers.
yeah, my parents desktop got destroyed from my downloads.
also porn.
I ruined many laptops from that.
kazaa into torrents.
Then Limewire.
but yes, limewire.
Then Kazaa.
Dude I was on Napster.
KaZaa.
who remembers limewire?
the first thing I ever downloaded was George Costanza's answering machine.
first thing i ever downloaded off the internet was probably a picture of tits.
...if only i could find a job.
^that's the first song i ever downloaded off the internet.
i'm actually pretty happy about where i am socially right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1fzJ_AYajA.
>rekt.
>Zeus ult now!
nor a cool adult.
i was not a cool child.
l2lead.
scrub.
reasonably so.
learning music from your younger brother.
the rap rubbed off on me though.
and because of that i was skeptical about the angsty shit.
i mostly learned about music through my brother.
Andy Esposito: Total Conformo.
answer: never enough.
how much sum 41 is on that playlist?
PROBABLY MEANS YOUR PARENTS UNDERSTOOD YOU FUCKIN CONFORMIST.
either way.
i'd say this was more of a middle school thing.
and i'm pretty happy about it.
i did not have this phase in hs.
this playlist is a jam.
*now listening to Jacks Mannequin*.
i jammed to that album last night jon.
gay marriage is mandatory now.
doesn't he know this is the 21st century?
not only that, he got married to a WOMAN!
*listening to My Chemical Romance*.
people from the bible.
know who got married?
woody's so behind in the times that he went and got MARRIED.
Woody's probably waiting for it to be mailed to him.
>Hardly know a darn thing and wish to read a heartwarming introduction.
"Heartwarming introduction".
>brian what hell.
ronnie knows not the subtleties of what hell.
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Mosaic_Netscape_0.9_on_Windows_XP.png.
Was hoping for a tag team effort there.
woody's favourite browser is Netscape Navigator.
had that heart lined up for it.
ronnie, i was eagerly awaiting your 'what hell'.
probably uses AskJeeves.
lol woody probably doesn't even know what google is.
>paiger .
but he never found a payphone and called me back.
Do you even fax?
guys guys! the earth revolves around the sun!
then why are you so fucking slow.
i sent him a paiger message!
Faxes are instant.
woody's only hearing about it now because he had to read a fax about it.
you were days ago.
Theres an appropriate amount of Good Charlotte in this playlist.
That was days ago.
:(.
probably the shooting woody.
theres no laughing when your face is as ugly as andy's.
If there is a flag flying half mast and I don't know why then it wasn't a big enough tragedy.
teenage dirtbag is a fucking jam.
there's no laughing when you're angsty.
also the song "teenage dirtbag".
it's missing laughter.
its missing new found glory and the ataris.
memory by sugarcult.
bitch its october, you're using heat?
this angst playlist is great. could use a few things though.
heating bill is due.
pay up mike.
for #what.
and we are all talking 100's of miles away from each other.
#oracle what does mike sound like.
I think that's just a mike quote. I think it's over tweaked on history.
i mean the robot did just respond to you.
drunk on a wednesday at 1pm, silly robot.
#oracle prove we are in the future .
side note, you will never see more hilariously optimistic people than in the comments section of r/futurology.
where everything is just 20 years away from being a reality.
woody this is the future.
woody grow up.
no.
Fuck.
Guys you can't attach physical goods to an email and mike doesn't have access to an electron microscope. Like stay reasonable.
they are large machines. they provide a good reference size to compare to my thunder.
using electron microscopes again mike?
�\.
but the attachment was too large to send.
i was going to send woody the email about my package.
also did you get the email about your package.
welp. gg.
welcome home.
Ah good to be back.
good game, well played.
on gabriel subscribed
you wouldn't have something to do with that would you.
Also my mom is using the phone.
or would you prefer smoke signals?
Ctn, working on my perfect away message.
woody, do you mind if i fax you my rsvps from now on?
no you have to go to AAA and get a trip tix.
one sec, i need to sign into my aol account to get them.
Maybe woody also wants us to print out our MapQuest directions before we go somewhere .
it triggers the "if you want my comeback..." response.
indeed.
using the word comeback is dangerous.
I mailed you my comeback. 
honeslty i showed up to basically everything. it shoulda just been: respond if you aren't coming.
Paper mail is an outdated and stupid practice. 
I know, you guys don't RSVP well.
You could give me 67 years to do something, I'd still wait until the day before to do it .
mostly because the other half is spent "i've got plenty of time, why work on it now?".
is the other 50% drunk or asleep?
1v1 mid Bo3 me bro.
"stress, you're fucked" is how i spend half of my life.
>Well played!
>Zeus ult now!
woody you should tense up, you're doing a terrible job.
Relax your doing fine.
*your.
you're face is like a simile.
also it was a simile you plebian.
i did not.
but i like that he's embraced it.
i'm not sure mike thought this metaphor through before starting.
and thats even better.
sometimes it will slightly waft to someone and ruin their day.
if you can get away with a miserable one for free, that's the best.
its ok, jokes are best like farts.
i'm not sure if i was upset or proud.
well arent you clever.
there have been at least a handful of times where i made jokes and no one in the group caught them.
he's just saying what we're all thinking.
duh andy would say that.
>and yeah snatch is pretty good.
wait i didnt catch andy's comment earlier.
the bio program here is like 65% women.
whatchu got there, numbers?
2.5% girls.
3/120.
to be fair there were... 3 girls in my program.
Lots of Sarahs kicking around.
true.
& sarah.
possibly hundreds.
but seriously, there were dozens of emilys and katies at uva.
jajajajaja.
que?
her?
It was Emily Mackey .
?
forgot about her.
Andy is your sister's friend.
No no no.
right.
ohhhhh.
my sister's friend andy.
Mackey .
thats the most vague name you could give.
emily who?
yeah emily.
was that playlist created by a uva grad?
sorry im no memelord.
today.
^^ good playlist in world.
http://open.spotify.com/user/ems4pc/playlist/1UfdaeFGKAK8td7RxC3Wcl.
get at me.
ten years of AGI gain.
10 years agi.
it's goddamn hilarious.
and i laughed.
yeah i've seen that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsKDg7Y28D8.
I don't have a weird cousin that likes Monty Python. Simply isn't an Asian thing. 
i have never seen it.
also *prepares oneself for boos*.
it could work in the right context.
yeah andy that isn't a word.
shutup moke.
>kind've.
so its annoying when they quote it.
it had the kind've universal popularity that even unfunny people like it.
but there is so much gold in that movie.
ez.
The whole French rant has been over done.
lol matt is this group's weird cousin.
Everyone has a weird cousin who likes that movie.
im happy to double down.
that shit is -the- funniest.
we're already not friends you canadian shitheel.
Mike is right.
mike.
..............
*is a jam .
that stopped being funny 10 years ago.
also i judge the fuck out of people who quote monty python and the holy grail.
Tokyo drift was a jam.
i only saw it once so i cannot comment.
I knew Ronnie would have my back on my trash movies. 
does "drive" count as a comedy.
And the raunchier Flesh Gordon.
Flash Gordon.
Its like eating junk food.
Pulp Fiction is always fun.
Princess Bride.
Man on fire.
matt on the other hand is spitting hot fire.
Ok Eric.
Good the Bad and the Ugly.
yeah i'm gonna have to call bullshit on a bunch of jons movies.
That's like a TBS daytime movie at best.
American Beauty is a good movie.
LOL.
Drum line! That made the cut?
REMEMBER THE TITANS .
its amazing.
watch it.
Drumline. Fast and the Furious Tokyo drift. 
guy ritchie makes some entertaining movies.
anfy i've never heard of this movie.
and yeah snatch is pretty good.
Caddy shack. Everytime it's on you have to watch it. 
i still need to sit down those of you who havent rewatched in bruges and fix that.
any Monty Python movie.
Snatch.
just both extremely well written.
also a ton of forshadowing about whats going to happen later in the movie.
both great comedies where when you rewatch them you see a shit ton of subtle jokes you missed the first time.
in bruges.
Forrest gump. Pineapple express. Billy Madison. 
hot fuzz.
What about good rewatching movies .
desrosiers changed name to judge.
"why are they fighting???".
during the sex scene.
well right now he likes jons the best.
Jon probably cries during Titanic.
He probably likes Woody's name the best .
so dragos is now the judge of all of our names.
matt was asking who is the judge of names.
Matt probably loves the movie Shakespeare in Love .
>Oops!
>what hell.
>who's name.
#who's name is judge?
Gg ez.
My name is judge #?
is it #?
that's simply not true.
I am omni knight.
you also quietly re-read stuff you write in chat during dota. 
and jon can't read so we can't ask him.
unless specifically primed to, i don't read things in a distinct voice.
No you are a freak.
*Head.
like, i have a go-to voice in my heard that I use to read chatwheel stuff.
does anyone else have this distinct voice they read chatwheel stuff in?
Ok enough being stupid at lunch back to werk.
Mat pls.
>Well played!
what jon meant to say was "Matt probably loves the movie. P.S. I love you.
Yeah, in a few hours maybe .
jokes on you haven't seen it.
Matt probably loves the movie PS I love you. 
Andy appleseed.
and it was about as exciting as watching a tree in real life.
then eventually i made more trees.
� is underused recently.
i was a tree.
you should watch my replay of me being a tree.
well i cant argue with that.
No �.
they was on point.
moke you should watch my enigma replay from last night and judge the black holes.
mostly what it feels like to be inside a butt.
Hips don't lie.
i have learned a lot from butts.
Also Butt. His other teacher was butt. 
cool as shit british dude.
A literal bomb.
my teacher was Mr. Atkins and he was the bomb.
Matt, like dota.
he said that part is never written by the author, may contain spoilers and is usually shitty.
your teacher is a dick.
I was Andy's teacher .
my teacher always used to criticize anyone who read the back panal of a book before reading the book.
I judge plenty of shit I know nothing about.
It's funny af.
I would watch the cock on a dock one most of the way through.
yeah, because you have to put something on the front.
ez.
Books have covers for a reason.
Team scroll through the porn video in 5 minute segments until you find the cool stuff.
but how can you possibly judge a movie if you haven't seen it the whole way through?
Heyyo.
definitely to finish.
I bet Andy watches porns start to finish.
I liked it a lot, just might be a lot to digest sometimes (which is why I mentioned it in the category).
even if they aren't great, if i've gotten through 30 min of a movie i'm gonna watch the whole thing.
am i the only person who never fucking turns off movies before they're over?
#gif cellar door.
Haters respond below:.
boo mike.
I got bored and turned it off.
i enjoy it every time i've watched it.
^hipster!
donnie darko is fantastic.
What about Donnie Darko .
also paul giovati.
I feel like most action movies aren't worth watching twice.
something about magic and his wife dying.
So I would enter that movie as my entry.
I can't even remember the plot of the illusionist.
because that was a great movie.
also, going on record to disagree with the prestige thing.
The twist was you were supposed to believe she was into shia lebouf.
Back door sluts 9. Once you know the twist (the pizza man turned out to be her father) it was just hard to get into it.
but the plot kinda sucked.
The last 30 minutes of Tokyo drift.
avatar was cool to watch the first time because of the awe inspiring visuals.
Transformers.
Also avatar ponytail sex .
because its fun to see them develop.
but even those movies are still good to watch again.
Can we generalize it to movies that have a twist that is hard to overlook when you know what happens .
also avatar.
because i would include the third batman movie.
Loved it.
are we just gonna say most christopher nolan movies?
I just watched ex machina .
Also Charlie Day.
I question prestige and Pacific rim. The surprise might be gone but they're well shot and directed films.
Memento.
I was thinking The Prestige. Maybe Pacific Rim (if you watched it in IMAX).
What's a movie that's really good your first time watching it but isn't that great watching again.
#oracle is amanda Girard cool?
caught creepin six years back.
she is a babe.
*is still creeping*.
gg Amanda Girard, pls nerf .
did he#?
>did you even try.
Lol gg ez .
lol, i can't believe thats a thing.
Your butt if freaky!
those are freaky.
These andy.
i'm not saying they don't taste good, i'm saying that the taste sometimes isn't worht the fucking hassel.
I like to think of the residue as lingering seconds. 
Also, stop eating like such a slob Andy.
^counter point.
https://smartcityfoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/A01-CHIPS0031.png.
> I want the flavor in my mouth
-Andy 2k15.
do better.
you know what sucks? any kind've chip/snack that is covered in a flavor powder. Doritos, Cheetos, non-original sun-chips etc... The point of these foods is to be finger foods, but they are so messy that i end up with crap all over my fingers and on my clothes. I want the flavor in my mouth, not on my shirt.
would poop.
I'm gonna take this moment to go creep on her. brb.
#oracle is amanda gerard smoking hot?
#gif amanda please.
LOL.
Does she smoke?
then #oracle tell us if smoking is cool.
sUN, does the truth hurt #?
the parental paradox.
do you consider being a good influence more important than telling the complete truth #?
damn sUN, you need some self-esteem lessons.
#oracle would you recommend drugs?
dont do #oracle,.
i 100% promise you that comma screws her up.
she knows it is, but she doesn't want to be a bad influence.
#oracle, really though.
#oracle is smoking cool?
#gif cinnabum.
At work, they started putting in these cinnamon scented urinal grates. Now every time I pee it smells like cinnapiss. Though I don't like cinnamon candy and shit, I guarantee anybody in this building who had a taste for it before no longer does. I'm shorting cinnamon. 
>Well played!
fucking baited.
rekt.
#gif pawg.
#oracle are you fucking sorry.
it means disrespect. tons of disrespect.
oracle mentions me a lot i feel like.
#oracle DID YOU EVEN TRY.
>DID YOU EVEN TRY.
> did you even try.
#oracle canada, eh?
it's adorable when jon streams random letters together to try to communicate.
> gg ez.
you're stupid!
Canada is stupid.
And their coffee gets worse by the year.
Switching from freshly baked donuts to shipping in frozen ones and then warming them up was pretty controversial.
Tim Horton's has really gone down the tubes in the past 10 years.
that's a recent move by them. upset a lot of canadians.
Yeah, it's fucking bullcrap.
i think.
also the closest one to me is in philidelphia.
apparently tim horton's is owned by burger king.
Definitely had my timmie's this morning.
#oracle why is mike the best person ever?
#oracle why is coffee the best thing ever?
he had some tim horton's this morning.
man that sounds tasty.
maple wheaties?
or whatever the candian version of that is.
clearly ate his Wheaties.
Matt is off to a rip-roaring start today.

#oracle what is the show due south like?
overall checks out.
i think we can all agree that pokemon is awesome, as well as fuck peter.
My sisters are lame.
My dog Jessie is the best.
I hate my cousin Peter.
Pokemon is the tightest shit ever.
Santa Clause is real.
i don't know 10 year old matt. what are some of his other opinions so i know whether to trust this one?
Andy that show sucked from what 10 year old Matthew remembers.

#gif hot cops.

I would send a picture of a slutty cop .
Best looking cops around.
Man the RCMP outfit is sharp.

That's Paul Gross from the hit Canadian television series Due South.
Nice dog Matt!
lol matt is a dog.
Here's a picture of Matt .
Couldn't have said it better myself, Mike.
*RCMPenis.
its all about who gets their RMCPenis out first.
Hi, mike and matt. Long time listener, first time caller. I was wondering, when you two bang each other, which is the mounter, and which is the Mountie?
my name is judge.
Chicka chicka slim shady.
#say my name.

#what should stu do for green poo?
i guess just remember the good times, stu. may sUN be with you.
classic woody, building up the gold advantage for us.
#oracle uh so I've been having green poop recently. What do I do?
Alright, let's open the lines back up. First caller, what is your question?
^more disrespectful.
>Good game.
>Good game, well played.
alt + ctrl click spam when someone pisses you off.
>Zeus ult now!
>Thanks!
>Get back!
All communication in doto can be done by pinging and chatwheel.
>bakc nwo cemo on.
look, it's not like i'm going to not heart a good what hell, but doto has ruined my capability to type fast and correctly.
>what hell.
>skyward swrod.
i havent played that one, or skyward swrod.
Sailing around that map was so goddang fun.
I think my favourite Zelda game is Windwaker.
dang right.
i've seen the pics.
Awesome.
Team Rocket #?
#what should matt think.
well now i dont know what to think.
we are both correct.
>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was the last GameCubeThe Legend of Zelda game and the first WiiZelda game.
*thinking.
You're think Skyward Sword.
Twilight Princess was for Gamecube.
i beat it, but goddamn that game was forever long.
is that the one with the wolf? twilight princess?
yeah I did. shit was un-fun.
you ever play the zelda on the wii? that bow and arrow was impossible.
classic Jon.

#who threw a wiimote in to their tv?
i can.
i cant believe people threw those into their televisions.
like a wiimote wriststrap.
Maybe yo^2 would need to come with some kind of fancy case to prevent pavement-phone interactions.
you are so 2000 and late.
i____ are all the rage right now.
yo^2.
how about that?
iYo.
this app has it all, really.
needs a more tech-oriented name tho.
which is honestly pretty funny.
now im just imagining old people trying to yoyo their phones and just throwing them onto the pavement.
looks like the lines are pretty quiet at the moment, mike, so let's go on to our next topic. Virtual YoYo - the hot new app and speculations of where it is in its development.
welcome to the mike and matt chat. we're now opening the phones to callers. hello, first caller, you're on the air.
yeah but that sucks.
to be fair, then you get to talk to jon.
you want to teamfight, WELL TOO BAD BECAUSE JON IS CALLING.
the worst thing that happens during doto is a skype call.
normally i run a script that disables the windows key when doto is up. prevents some nasty surprises from my clumsy hands.
ty moke.
http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/the-complete-list-of-windows-logo-keyboard-shortcuts/.
I've never used win + D before, but it's much smoother.
It is actually.
is that the same was win + D?
for whatever reason it just doesnt work when doto is up.
sike no it isnt.
also windows + M is gone too.
probably jumped the gun. jon did you notice windows 10 completely took away the windows + C hotkey? i liked using it to quickly see what time it is, since i normally auto-hide the taskbar for more screen real estate.

So I'm supervising exams for 5 different courses today, 4 bio and 1 chem. This girl just showed up and I asked her which exam she was here for and she looked at me and said "science.".
It was hilarious.
There was a guuy with a relatively nice RC drone on our trip up north. It was probably worth about $3000 and fitted with a GoPro and the guy had (apparently) a ton of experience flying it. So one day we're out on the land on a beautiful windless sunny day, and the guy says it's time to finally break the drone out because there had been too much wind previously. BUT, since we were so far north and so close to the pole, it really messes with the remote control signal. He got the thing off the ground, and was flying it steady for maybe 5 seconds, and then the thing just fucking ZOOMS away right in to a cliff face and crashes to the ground.

My name is judge .
they may have phrased it differently, but the message was the same.
i've heard some say they take pride in how much they suck.
and mike is right, girls do in fact suck. some more than others.
in a technical sense.
girls are living things .
but i mean all in all things are alright. could be better could be worse. i got friends like jon, but, on the other hand, i have friends like andy.
lights go out when you got spunk in your eyes.
ten years ago i was 14. i think i wanted to be a vet then, but then i realized biology and other living things suck.

Jan, I've lived with women too on separate occasions, and I've had an even mix of tidy and messy with them. I'm pretty tidy myself, but I can't say from my experience that women are generally messier than men.

this is true. its a term thrown around a lot these days, but i think i might have a bit of it. its fun.
thats because you are moderately ocd jon.
also surprising how much cleaner I am than girls.
shes married now, but i saw her naked a couple times by accident. it was cool.
i lived with one girl in college my junior year.
(there was a spare).
by 10:30 i was wearing 7 barbour jackets.
once fourth year i was living in a house with 6 uva women. sam and i started drinking at like 9 am because college.
dont worry I have both.
I did mean barbour jackets.
thats a... shitty milkshake.
freeze the milkshake, boom ez cold dildo.
i think you would have a hard time making a milkshake into that, butt.
everything is a dildo too.
every milkshake is alcoholic if you try hard enough, andy.
i had a smore's one the other day and it was delcious.
there is a burger place near me that sells alcoholic milkshakes.
im sorry stu did you mean barbour jackets.

yes, andy, that thing you just said establishes you as a dork, a title nobody else in this chat would ever claim for their own.
Lol everyone check out the Battlestar Galactica dork .
(not to me specifically).
someone in the subreddit pointed that out to me.
also, idk if anyone here has ever seen battlestar galactica, but tammy's parents were characters from that.
Or squanches Ricks BFF bracelet .
i really liked ricks wedding speech notes: i've known bird person since... (trail off) (toss note) (ad lib).
I like the squanch guy.

so definitely a good episode.
but this season was really good.
as established in my list, this is my 6th favorite episode of the season.
apparently the distortion in the episode is just the regular song.
im relistening to the song.
yeah nin, the original.
Is that the NIN song at the end.
I loved it. 
then again you could probably just play "hurt" in general and i'd probably think something is heartfelt.
was the group opinon on that last episode negative? again not their best but i enjoyed it.
The few stupid things in that episode were so good .
I'm not staring at you. I'm a cyborg photographer. 
its probably awesome.

First part of the plan was good.
then ask if she wants to be your next bitch.
then you can say you are thinking of getting rid of the dog, because you suspect he's stealing from you.
Pros: has a dog. Cons: illiterate.
say that you have a companion dog that types for you.
if a girl asks you you are messaging if you cant read.
"Also I can't read".
it works, because like charlie, you can't read.
I like that one more.

Dislikes: people's knees.
Likes: milk steak, jelly beans.
Mine is basically just a sunny quote.

Just here for some snu snu.
alright one sec.
Say as many stupid things as you'd like, I'll copy and paste .
Andy. Think of a clever tinder blurb for me. Its time, I've never put something there. 
tell her you'll introduce her to some long division.
I met this girl during firefly. She was on acid the whole time. Not surprised she doesn't know precalculus .
dont let your dreams be dreams, jon.

#oracle moke joke.
I kept on thinking of taco bell making cool ranch flavored host for churches and it being super successful .
apparently "jesus crackers" isn't the appropriate term for a communion wafer.
can confirm.
i did make so many inappropriate jokes. former alter boy moke desrosiers was not amused.
I wanted to make so many inappropriate jokes in church that day. 
Andy and me, "uh".
Liz, "Why did Jon just say salty? What does that mean?".
#rekt.
jon, remember at the rehearsal dinner where i texted you to turn around just so i could show you a salt shaker and mouth "salty?".
no u.
Lucille Bluth is the saltiest.

RIP in peas.
fuck you you knife nippled bastard!
Rest in Peas (served with peas).
is it just a list of pun-named burgers.
we can also agree that cone shaped nipples are the superior race.
there's a cookbook?
I preordered the bobs burgers cookbook and I'm stoked.
in.
its like early simpsons.
you would like it.
haven't watched it, but I do love puns.
we can all agree that bob's burgers is a good show.
and im pretty into that.
they have a lot of shitty puns.
i like bob's burgers.
the rest will happen naturally.
alternatively i will show jon a pic of a hot girl.
i shall poop for god.
"my god is the biggest dick that never existed!".
#what would you like a sacrifice of?
ok your god is a dick.
#what do you have confidence in.
ever mysterious.
#oracle how should we worship you?
can i #?
dont tell me how to interpret my god!
get fuckin rekt.
holy fuck andy.
>this guy.
new years.
ny.
god get rekt.
no but being in NY and Florida at the same time does.
being around since 2011 doesn't make you omnipresent Andy.
sUN telling us she is omnipresent so we should worship her.
#oracle what god should we be worshipping?
wasn't tehre a shitty tv series on Noah's Ark?
things jon is: tiny rick, judge, omniknight.
#oracle whats your favourite show.
and tiny rick. my name is also tiny rick.
charcuterie.
my name is judge.
>what hell.
>charactitures.
and yeah, he is entertaining.
some of the characters are more charactitures than real people, but overall it works pretty well.
Titus is fuckin hilarious.
yeah, i watched it this weekend because of a girl, and thought it was pretty good.
I like that show.
what do people think of kimmy schmitt?
*because of a bear.
4.Andy.
please note that i am not calling liz a lady.
mike is not wrong, also 4 weddings.
SAVAGE!
LOL MIKE!
> more like parks and rekt.
andy you've probably watched all of say yes to the dress because of a girl;.
I like parks and rec.
so no regrets.
but that show was good.
i also watched all of parks and rec because of a girl.
And actually, I started Dexter because of a squirrel too.
Jon, I watched 5 seasons of True Blood because of a girl.
no regrets.
jon i also watched dexter because of a hot girl.
i've watched a ton of gilmore girls.
and the OG CSI was good but became cliche really quick.
second biggest mistake i've ever made.
not more than the others though.
I also watched the first two season of Gilmore Girls because of a girl I used to date.
yeah CI wasn't bad.
I also enjoyed criminal intent for what it was.
there were a few.
love svu and OG.
jan which hot girl.
Probably the biggest mistake i've ever made.
I watched the entire series of Dexter because that hot girl I liked enjoyed the show.
except the simpsons comment... it's way past their bedtime.
everything I said was the complete opposite.
#gif judge my name.
#gif my name is judge.
yeah, i wasn't sure whether stu was being sarcastic for a lot of those comments.
i'd watch it before bed.
hence all of my comments up until now.
too many nightmares.
The Wire is the worst drama on tv.
why did you stop watching svu?
#oppositeday.
i had to stop watching SVU.
sUN, is it opposite day #?
Ice T is a chump.
SVU is pretty good, way darker but that's the nature of the show.
ice t all day.
i personally prefer SVU.
woody isn't reading this matt, but he would have supported that comment.
the OG Law and Order is tight as tits.
question: why does everyone think woody harrelson's side biddy is crazy?
*syndrome.
sty you shut your dirty mouth.
i liked it too at first, but in retrospect it was like stokholm synrome.
it good.
csi:LA is better than all of Law & Order.
im watching td now.
true detective season 2 > season 1.
Season 3 was utter crap, but I gave it a second chance.
finalyl someone is on my side here.
I was REALLY in to dexter up until season 5.
and Matt is proof that canada will never amount to shit on a world scale.
Dexter is proof that there's a hell.
>fuck you.
Rick and Morty.
ok.
lets change it up and talk about terrible shows.
Ted really just speaks from the heart.
Coronation Street, scrub.
himym is the best show on earth with 9 or more seasons.
Yeah it's definitely deteriorated, but man, they had atleast 10 years of unbelievably good writing, animation, and humour.
maybe get, but not stay.
I still maintain that The Simpsons is the best show to ever get on television.
building up a storyline throughout a season is a pretty good development for a show that has been around as long as they have.
"at the end of the episode, everything is the exact same".
I haven't watched it lately.
futurama said it right.
yeah, but i do like they are serializing the show a bit more.
no plotline is independent of current events.
south park of late has gotten too serious.
stu...just leave.
none of these silly cartoons.
And we can all agree that Get Shwifty was a jam .
But if you look at a show like the Simpsons or South Park, they do all of that and waaaay more in terms of the intellect of the show.
I think we can all agree that modern family is the greatest show of our generation.
Totally, mike .
penis.
where else can you get that.
Yeah, all of which I appreciate.
the show can be heartfelt, irreverent, goofy and deep.
I've voiced my opinion on this show before. I think it's doing something really different in terms of its animation and stories, which is great, but I think the humour is really really weak.
You sided with a fuckin idiot!
fuck.
well now i disagree with matt too.
LOL look at who you sided with Andy!
hm yes shallow and pedantic.
Overall, I think Rick and Morty is very meh. I give them mad points for creativity, but I think their humour is pretty cheap and effortless at times.
I went through the past few messages and only read mikes half cause that's the correct half .
this is it. this is the great battle of our time.
> My man!
you suck.
I agree with Andy.
Schwifty sucked.
I stand by what I wrote.
> what hell.
>erektion.
I'm getting such an erektion listening to you two right now.
it might be believable, because if you were then you'd be as shitty of a father as you are at everything else in your life.
you dont know where i been.
you dont know me.
i might be.
because you're not my real dad.
but either way, you don't get to tell me what to do.
if i wasn't at work i'd probably be doing it now.
which is incidentally what i was going to suggest regardless.
which is something i do often.
if we are the same person then that would be the same as you going and fucking yourself.
because fuck you.
and i refuse to believe either that we are different people or that we could be friends.
the only reason i thought it was better than the interdimensional cable episode (which at least had a decent b-plot) was because it was more memerable in certain parts.
maybe in a different place, we could have been friends.
well i guess we're just two different people andy.
now that you mention it.
i thought the overall premise was shitty too.
is that what threw your willing suspension of disbelief?
im sorry was the ice-t bit silly in a episode based on an intergalactic music talent search.
the ice-t thing was a bit silly, and rick giving a speech about how not caring is bad was completely out of place.
characters acted inconsistently with other episodes, the b-plot was weak at best.
i'd agree with you but then we'd both be wrong.
and schwifty was quotable but not a good episode.
i could include an overall list of all 21 episodes but that seems like a lot.
also, boo. get schwifty was a jam.
yeah.
oh are you just rating S2?
all the rest were very good tv.
yeah, the bottom 2 are the only 2 episodes where I think the show just simply didn't do a good job.
i also did not like that one at all.
also shutup moke.
>what hell.
would love to discuss what people agree/disagree with.
>Calbe.
1) Autoerotic Assimilation (E3)
2) Total Rickall (E4)
3) Mortynight Run (E2)
4) The Ricks Must be Crazy (E6)
5) A Rickle in Time (E1)
6) The Wedding Squanchers (E10)
7) Look Whose Purging Now (E9)
8) Big Trouble in Little Sanchez (E7)
9) Get Schwifty (E5)
10) Inter Dimensional Calbe II (E8).
alright, i made this list.
lame.
Sun demanded a blood sacrifice Andy. Don't blame me. 
desrosiers added Andy Esposito to the group.
The best part is that Andy was bored at work and was going to probably really like the GroupMe today.
desrosiers removed Andy Esposito from the group.
K bye.
#Kobe how many votes to boot Andy.
Vote with hearts.
#oracle is it possible to induce flaws in the model of a composite matrix through the thickness.
Mike has not.
It was a very solid finale, I'm kinda bored at work so I think I'm gonna rank this season's episodes .
Has anyone not watched it other than woody, since mexico doesn't get television. 
Gross jon.
I squanched that episode Andy .
Omg everything is on a cob!

^.
#?
Mjd2dh?
^this guy. smart.
Erika and I put a hold on everything. Nothing should be delivered till Wednesday. No idea if that works for these packages though.
yeah docx will be fien.
Word.
ok. andy send me the tracking info.
Mike yes please. Erika and I are worried about stuff at a our place.
I can track the package online, so I will let you know what they do with it.
And from there, I guess we just ride this mystery train together.
if you're amenable, i can swing by after work and grab it so its not sitting out, or hide it somewhere discreet at your house woody.
So they'll show up and you wont be home.
Idk. I had it delivered to your place.
"Pick up from somewhere"... That's kinda vague. In Charlottesville? DC?
Word. Your present is arriving tuesday, so you might have to pick it up from somewhere. Idk how that works.
What about mayonnaise or salad dressing? Anything which can separate. 
which states.
States Tuesday, home Wednesday .
well that was the missing link. i dont whip much cream.
Woody, when do you get back from mexico?
Whisking things? Ever tried to whip cream with a fork. You can't .
Why.
Mike a whisk is core. Core.

When butters though people used the toilet backwards. You know so there's a shelf for your comic books and chocolate milk. 
Butters is the best. 
Jon that south park snap you just sent is one of my favourite moments from the show. It's also why butters is my favourite character.
I also made fun of Michael aboffs birth mark on his hand thinking it was Hawaiian punch. 
In preschool my mom used to pack my lunches. She packed whatever I wanted, so she use to make me just mayonnaise sandwiches. White bread and mayo. And also a bag of croutons.

Pepsi Blue is radioactive poison and should never be resurrected.

Had to have been awful for you. But 11 year old butt didn't give a fuck. 
wasnt there like a 2 year period where everyone came out with weird variants? mtn dew code red etc.

Barry O. So fucking cool mike. 
but willy s.
not barry o.
andy did your dad work with this scrub.
That guy probably smoked weed .
Yes. Mike. Yes. 
If I had some weed I'd also watch interstellar for the first time soon .
i wish gatorade rain were still a thing.
You'd be losing money by not getting it!
economists are baffled.
its like, $2 for 1, then $3 for 2.
2 for $3 always seem crazy.
You know, just so we have it. 
There was a deal! Couldn't pass it up. 
I'll probably make myself a chocolate milk later with Hershey's syrup.
also curious what drove the dual color gatorade purchase. just buy-curious?
tomato soup with gatorade sounds questionable, but the soup + sandwich is a smart move.
The capistrami was too heavy and I didn't want a sweet sandwich with the Bobbie. 
Not gonna lie, thats a pretty weak sandwich.
Also two Gatorade's. One red, one glacier freeze. 
I got a turkey with lettuce, tomato, mayo and crushed red pepper spread. And a large tomato soup. 
Jon what sandwich from capriottis?
jon lets cuddle to keep warm .
Readings from the Book of Jon: "Lo, did I get food from Wawa. And though it were raining, the journey was made. Then I saw a pretty girl and pooped.".
^Life MVP. Teach me. 
Getting Capriottis and a tomato soup from Wawa. Ez rainy day. 
that is an incredibly generous "she".
the fucker collected souls .
She played a mean Shadow Fiend. That's basically the devil. 
i'll send you guys gifs.
I would guess heaven.
I just want to go to wherever sUN is.
Unless the GroupMe still works .
I don't wanna go to Heaven if you guys are in hell. 
Ez hell.
then more stealing = more likely to be in hell. this is a win-win plan.
so we steal woody's couch. already stole his microphone.
Matt makes a good point.
Imagine how sticky it'd be.
A leather couch in hell.
thats a smart idea. i bet there are a lot of people there, and limited seating options. also, leather couch masterrace.
Yeah, I want to bring my couch.
what, to hell?
Do you have a truck I can borrow to help me move?
see you there babe.
You can all go to hell.
Or a house into a moving truck. 
it would have been more impressive if you'd managed to back a stationary truck into anything.
It is thanks for asking.
I backed a moving truck into my supervisor's house today. I hope your Fridays are going better than mine.
Walking through the rain to that shit was a trip.

i blame the car only if a gun is driving it.
Loud n proud.
Mike I'm on team android.
I also got into an unexpected discussion with a guy in McDonalds about gun control. Apparently there was a shooting at some community college somewhere in the US and the man turns to me and goes, I bet you they blame guns. We discuss further and he uses the analogy of, when a drunk driver kills someone do you see people blaming the car?

Welcome to Jon hour. Trending topics: looking at snot, poop, butts. 
I look at the snot. 
good point i guess.
Jon's asking hard hitting questions. I'm giving hard hitting answers .
Rorschach tests.
when i blow my nose i make butterfly shaped snot stains in the tissue.
we're trying to have a nice conversation here, don't go messing it up.
ok ronnie thats gross.
Also make sure there's no blood .

I wouldn't run off with them. I'm no Jesse Owens .
Obviously I didn't disclose my new banana peeling process. Not going to let you run off and do this before me. Who do you think I am? Terrell Owens? 
I don't think you can patent the process of peeling a banana. But I think the process is so slow and bureaucratic that you could skate by with a patent pending. Then in a few years move on before they notice that they're just peeled bananas .
I'll send you a full prospectus by EOW. 
I like what you've got.
Quick is relative. 
Get rich quick scheme: Banana Sausages. 

Sell peeled bananas as non-cased banana sausages. Mark up price to 5 bucks for 5 mouth watering banana sausages. Patent process. Use peels in compost to grow more banana (sausages). Hope that the Panama disease doesn't wipe your crops. Sell your business before people realize they are just eating peeled bananas. Reinvest and repeat with tomato tea (tomato soup) .

it has been a difficult mating season for bird-person.
I don't know enough about girls to refute it.

After going through the comments, the world seems to have also noticed the girl in the bottom right being the most attractive.
Jon my favorite comment was "The real takeaway here is baseball is such a boring sport they can talk about the girls for like 15 or 20 seconds at a time then just cut to the 1 second pitch where nothing happens before jumping immediately back to the girls.".
👏💩👏💩👏💩👏💩👏💩👏💩👏.
And you're the author.
Jon I just read the most poetic poop story ever.
Here here .
Meghan Lyons. Middle school crush material .
wow that is a heck of a description jam.
Meghan Lyons, hot but has as much soul as Mr. Bean singing Barry White. 
i hope these really long messages get included in oracle and make future life confusing.
good questions, I like where your minds at. 
inquiring minds.
are sara and megan not pretty.
And how bad my poop smelled. 
Its worse because of how good looking she is .
i cannot believe that the nyce poop was worse than that story.
next time someone questions why i have TP in my car, i am going to refer to this story (leaving out jon's name).
I remember one time I was in rockford park and really had to poop. It was the middle of the night and I was with a bunch of people so I tried to clench my buttcheeks and tried slowly to waddle across the park to the only bathroom in the park. I took Tim Saunders with me cause I knew this was going to be a traumatic event. I get to the bathroom and of course with my luck the bathrooms are locked. I make the decision to poop in the woods and wipe with my boxers as much poop as I could. I ditched the underwear in the middle of the woods. I walk back, full of shame and with Tim laughing at me, to a group that now had Megan Lyons and Sara Adelman. We decide to get in a car where I have to fucking sit with my poopy butt in a air tight car with of course both of the girls smelling my poop. Might have been the most shameful poop I've ever taken next to that time at the Nyces.
he's afraid of getting dumped.
jon's natural response to hot girls is to poop.
also that announcer is :salty:.
I also need to poop.
That girl bottom right really is hot doe. If you watch it again, shes da bomb.com. Eating ice cream from cold stones.
its hilarious.
if i can figure it out later, i'll share the recording andy was talking about. it's weird.

that's literally the entire story of the illiad going over for one instagram hottie.

jon is the guy on instragram looking at all the pics they were taking.
She is hot doe. Shes eating an ice cream.
jon you think girls are gross though, what is going on here.
The girl bottom right though is pretty hot though. I am part of the problem.
@Sty  my favorite comment was "heres my first bite of the churro, heres my second bite of the churro".
Also, Mike, an eyewash station in our building burst over the weekend and flooded the bottom 2 floors of the building. A preposterous amount of water comes out of those things.

I've always identified with Johnathon more as well .
shut up matt.
Obviously it doesn't really bother me but I've always seen Matt and Matthew as two separate names, and I've always identified with Matthew more.
I'm gonna let you guys in on a secret. I've always preferred being called Matthew over Matt for that reason. I remember when I was a kid.someone told me a mat is something you wipe your feet on, and ever since I never really liked being called it.
Woodys name is a dick .
Stew .
Matts name is something you walk on.
speaking of being able to afford things i actually owe you money, so maybe this is my fault.
My name is a toilet .

technically possible but the ability for her to reply to herself was removed when # help was implemented because she just barfed responses.

I don't know much about Portugal. 
no, terrible idea. since i went back and divulged some future stuff to the germans, they united and conquered england in a blaze of glory. the crown moved its capital to the colonies, which firmly established their dominion over the new continent. weakened from the attack, they could never manifest destiny the rest of what could have become the united states of america, and instead france kept the lousiana territories and most of the valuable carribean trading islands. with the english navy quelled, the portuguese were the dominant seagoing power, and kept, what, africa?
1740? Time to bet on the American colonies am I rite?
in this hypothetical scenario? 1740. I've travelled back in time. I've managed to record bach, live. turns out music tastes sucked back then and we've really just interpreted his scores in a way that fortunately sounds good to the ear. cholera is everywhere. being white is pretty sweet. i didn't buy anyone but it was an option. drinking water is a risky proposition.

however my boner around a 12 year old mike would be huuuuge.
^ what a weird thing to say dragos .
your boner must be tiny if youre 12.
Am I 12 #?
When you get [...] hard [...] it's a great feeling.
When you get a forcestaff as a hard 5 it's a great feeling.
going back: totally agree with Andy and Jon about enjoying being a position 5. It's pretty fun if you have competent teammates and it makes you so much more valuable in the game. A good support really brings out good teammates, but a good support doesn't do much for shitty teammates.
nah.

Okay.
no.
Get it.
Then we could say Jon is really coming out of the shell.
> Well played!
Mike and Matt with the fucked up questions .
okay.
is jon fucking the dead turtle #?
Would you fuck a turtle though.
(for a heart transplant for those unfamiliar with the reference, jon is not fucking a turtle in this scenario).
would you have given that turtle your penis to save it?
No no Andy. This turtle was the martin luther king Jr of turtles .
It's turtles all the way down bud.
it will come back as a tortoise actually. reincarnation is a slow climb, and he was an only slightly above average turtle.
maybe it was reincarnating in a higher being, turtle being promoted  to jons next gf.
Reincarnation dragos.
It was in front of a Buddhist temple .
fuck; i love turtles; now im sad.
Also as I was writing that I saw a turtle get absolutely demolished on the road. 
gotta powernap before though ; had 5 hours of sleep in the past  2 days.

but i could maybe be up for some dota later.
I kid, I actually enjoy supporting. Mostly because I hate it when anyone else supports other than Andy and dragos. 
but solo ranked gives me cancer.
so its all good when i'm with you guys.
i'm super ok with hard 5 when i have competent teammates.
It sucks being Andy and Dragos. 
Ever since the supports have played less dota, I've had to play hard 5 more and more.

you just nee to get more creative with your chat wheel commands.

i still dont own a microphone and it's pretty miserable to play with my chum-pals without the ability to communicate. jon can confirm poor results.

that is a very generous use of the word, "best".
0% success rate.
my best pickup line is to poop in a bathroom and wait for the girl to walk in after im done.
it works sometimes.
cam, my best pickup line is "wanna make out?".
it is but not by a lot.
keep trying mike.
also sample size still to small.
but is it that much lower than other things you have said?
2) don't tell her you are inebriated and watching LOTR. success rate is very low on that front.
dragons pls.
1) i think we desperately need dragos to assist here.
say you're a well cultured man.
tell her you know so much about Micrococcus bacteria because of your micro cock.
I wouldn't mind breeding with this female. She's wicked Smaaaht.
tell her you you can help with her genetics assignment.

I twerked with everyone.
or at least.
I'm pretty sure we all twerked with each other.
No regrets.
nothign wrong with that.
Woody, your dad saw me and Andy getting freaky on the dance floor. When I asked how the eyeful was, he said, 'once is cool, but twice is gay'. Andy, between grinding and salsa dancing, you and I were super gay. 
that was a compliment, not a complaint.
My go to order was: rum and coke, but mostly rum.
The crowd wanted liquor. They got what they wanted.
the booze flowed.
I thought the bartender's instructions were well executed.
Ty stu.
pretty sure whoever gave them the recipe for juleps just said, "bourbon and ice".
andy you killed it in the dance circle.
Memory hazy. Try again later.
i do not remember that.
I remember that. My proudest moment .
and the dance circle.
the dance train was awesome.
Also Ronnie you led the dance train!
Your mom gave me props on my dancing .
Ronnie Ma, lord of the dance.
Erika just said "I don't think I ever saw Ronnie not dancing".
Killed it .
Ronnie you danced for like 3 hours.
suckas I'm gonna be chillen.
I either browned out or was just too in the zone bc the dancing seems like a very short time when I look back on it .
Whoops.
I have been basically doing nothing at work for the past week and now my boss wants this thing I was supposed to have been working on by the end of the day.
I have zero desire to be at work right now. My legs are still kinda sore from all the dancing .

theresa feels like a very hit or miss name. hot or old?
That'll be my opener.
Tell Theresa this guy in big America hates her .
I'll wing it.
don't duck it up.
Getting drinks with Theresa later and this shirt will seal the deal.
Mike this shirt rocks. I feel so cool walking around in it.
Also its a funny picture .
and has both a winning smile and an unflappable sense of right and wrong.
he is very handsome.
Why is everything always about woody.
woody def gets to finish out september because he's getting married and that picture is great.
but also matt Sept2015 has to be WOODAY.
group picture changes.
fuck can we have groupme members of the month?
I nominate mike for Groupme Member of the Month Sep2015.
#oracle are you more likely to come up with a coherent response if your prompt is longer?
Sike who knows.
#oracle what should we call stu?
You need explicit subjects or it doesn't know who "we", "what", or "me" refer to.
#oracle what should we call me?
>that's you. that's what you sound like.
it feels like GladOs more and more.
it seems like mre complex sentences are more likely to provoke interesting responses from the code.
at least that half feels like a sick burn.
>you would have found out if she truly likes you; now you dont know; now you are ignorant.
sUN u so deep.
But with some pretty deep meaning to it.
I think that's an insult?
Complex sentence.

I think she said she pleasured matt too.
i read all the messages and saw no such thing.
this is awkward. when you weren't here, she said she was a pleasure bot.
see. way to go mike.
sUN, are you by any chance a pleasure bot #?
mike if you were smart you'd program a robot that did what you wanted.
i really wanted it to respond, "i don't understand what your message means," but WELP CODE.
classic semen.
#what should I include in my love letters?
that's a language we can all understand.
#oracle what would i respond to someone who wrote me a letter, but the letter was written in german, a language i do not understand at all?
that wasn't the plan all along?
we need to get bottles of absinthe to throw at people.
valid point kevin.
gotta show off the thunder.
actually no, dragos should be a chemist on the shoulders.
what else do you think stu wears?
jan, sit on sty's shoulders. sty, you've got to wear only a vest and tigh pants.
apparently a midget around your shoulders.
#oracle, what's the best outfit to wear to woody's wedding?
#gif fuck work .
#gif are you stupid or are you deaf.
#oracle who said it better.

I'll go navy suit then but bring khakis as a backup.

we could roll on jajaja to decide arguments.
jajajajajaja.
Jajajaja.
Fuck Jon.
Opposite color scheme of Jon .
I'm probably going navy blazer and grey pants .
But I gotta look the best.
Yep.
You're wearing a suit Woody?
Well I don't want to look like no scrub. 
Eric said suit but khaki+blazer was an option?
Sty either is ok. Tie required.
Ronnie that's okay as long as you bite erikas finger off.
Also did we ever resolve suit or khaki+blazer?
Who is bringing the doves.

Then we'll turn it into a kangaroo court.

Whip out a gavel.
Andy you need to object.
then woody will push you into the the pit of fire every catholic church keeps around.
I'll be gollum and try to snatch the ring just before you put it on erikas finger .
omg woody lighten up a bit and let the boys have a bit of fun.
No.
q: can we dress up as ringwraiths and try to steal the rings from you on friday?
She also hasn't seen the rings, or her gift.
No.
has erika seen you in suit.
Ain't no newb shoes. Pro stuff over here. Just got Erika jewelry as a gift. Feeling like a baller.

i wonder if theresa is listening too.
He's talking about the Syrian Refugee crisis now.
school of hype sounds fun.
#oracle how funny are butt farts? 
that is why he is watching meow.
not for himself.
he was saying for us.
but jan u cant read.

Shits fire right now, worth reading later what he's saying.

Some type of way .
or, and stay with me here, parachute in through the skylight and land on the podium and dropkick the priest of the way and then give the speech.
woody can i fly in to your wedding and give that speech?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bY0fdgpISc.
>where'd you get a bag?
now im imagining erika and woody as orge magi.
can't argue with that.
2 people > 1 people, that's just straight facts.
woody + erika = marriage.
#oracle why should I get married?
an earful, from gran.
#what is going to be the best thing to happen at woody's wedding.
shame, mike, shame.
sUN you are an engima.
You told her you'd get her Dodgers tickets and you never did.
#what does gran hate about mike?
now. but i'll figure it out.
She doesn't. And she hates you.
im sure gran's got stories. try me. old people find me charming.
Maybe you'll be near the single ladies.
Yea. What of it. I'll uninvite you in a heartbeat. I control where you sit. Granny table? You'll be there .
papal infallibility is not an all-the-time thing, and is a relatively recent concept IIRC.
yeah, nerd!
you're just hype on the pope because you're getting married catholic in like two days.
On looking that statement up with Wikipedia, not really.
Da pope is da man. According to Catholics he literally can't make a mistake. He's infallible. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpkWT5voTSE.
The pope is speaking to congress right now. Everything he's saying has this response..
All I found was a bunch of porn I'm still confused.
which is...

but yeah, back in the cold war days honduras was 3rd squirrel.
the whole 1st - 5th world country system is pretty arbitrary now and means very little anyway.
So tell her to go fuck herself.
Also I'm pretty sure Honduras WAS a third world country. It didn't align with the U.S. Or the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
kind of yeah.

Who else have you met. 
Mbna main management conference back when my dad worked there (and when it still existed). They would bring famous people up there like athletes and politicians.
Context?
I met him once.
Kidding, I would. 
I wouldn't care if you died either. 
Assuming baseball, I don't care.
Assuming he bats 4 times a game, that's insane. 
Yogi Berra died today. I heard an absurd stat that he had a season where he only struck out 12 times. That's in a 162 game season.

I didn't intend for this to be philosophical at all.
Just know that I will side with whatever Erika says but Erika loves stu almost as much as me so I don't think she'll care.
It's hilarious.
Do what Jan said.
Yeah, but stu's gf has made it clear she prefers the beard, and stu has to live with paulina.
Shave your balls and say that should count. 
the bride gets whatever she wants stu; shave that shit.
Kk.
I'll ask her.
She said "clean shaven" but that could mean trimmed.
I haven't been shaven in over two years I don't think.
Well actually ask her. 
I'll trim but not full shave.
Wait really?
Stu shaving is mandatory. Not joking. Erikas word is law.

woody you also never answered my question... what are you wearing right now?
im going back to the sargent-well.
and are bow ties acceptable.
or sports coat with tie.
Good interpretation. If only we had the groom in a chat we use everyday. 
does coat and tie mean suit?
I prefer dictated but not read.
Upon further research the mailed invite does say coat and tie. Which I interpret as 420 blazer or higher .
woody did actually mention it in one of the 5 groupme chats.
I'm a fan of carrier pigeon these days .
or pager notifications.
also i take my communications primarily by fax these days.
>I'm Tiny Rick!
Fuck you. 
After retracing steps I have concluded that you sent no email to me, your Facebook message contained a lot of information but nothing in regard to what we're wearing on Friday for the rehearsal (like we were asking) and nowhere in any GroupMe did you ever mention anything in regard to attire either. 
I will return with either an apology or a fuck you. I hope its the fuck you. 
Time to retrace all steps .
Jon can't read.
Jesus people can you fucking read. I only emailed, GroupMe'd, Facebook messages and literally mailed messages.
^ @english122 doesn't that sound like Tim and Eric.

woody what are you wearing.
I was planning khakis and blazer? but I could suit it up.
my question still is: blazers + khakis or full on suit?

also when do i need to be where frieday.
suit on friday, tux on saturday, ...... coat and tails sunday?
we're talking like, nice suit for dinner on friday, yeah?
Woody what's for dinner on Friday? 
@Rich Homie Jon fuck applebees. Quesadilla burgers should be a slam dunk but they made it shitty .
https://youtu.be/Gj4-E5Hs3Kc.
Friday dinner is big FYI.
its not that i hate the episode. its just significantly worse than most of their other episodes.
Its a lot more stupid plotless humor. Tim and Eric like humor. 
Mike, you can watch the episode online on Adult Swims website.
well seeing as both you and i liked get schwifty, and andy wasn't big on it, i expect i will like this one too.

>sorry.

you're neat.
This was a neat conversation .
tight.
NASA has a test site there for Mars Rovers.
and when we were on Devon Island, he was pretty stunned at how much it reminded him of the surface of the moon.
He'd always say "Come in Hong Kong" over the radios and "Go for launch" and all kinds of astronaut lingo when we were out on the land.
totally understandable.
and being back on earth forever just didn't seem like enough.
she descirbed space as that part of a roller coaster where you feel your stomach rise up a little, a neverending thrill.
I had a professor in undergrad who was an astronaut and I talked to her about it a few times, and she just seemed sad.
being more and more in this field, being an astronaut seems cool and all, but it doesn't seem worth it.
tv series.
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3530726/.
tell me about it. Like, she's a sweetheart and they've been married for 53 years and seem really happy. But she's got some serious baggage and honestly she seems pretty brainwashed.
I actually think there is a movie coming out aboutastronaut wives.
yea.
thats kinda weird.
She gave a whole talk about it. It caught a lot of people off guard.
and she had some serious mental health issues once Charlie got back from the moon and was very public in saying that he wasn't a good husband and always put her second to whatever he had going on in his life. SHe said that divorce was super common amongst astronauts, and she didn't want to go down that road, so she seriously considered suicide for a time. She eventually came to Jesus and is super religious and I guess Jesus saved her. She said that God spoke to her and all this stuff and it made her realize her duty was to show Charlie she loved him even if she didn't actually feel it.
so his wife was on the trip too.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect.
'murica.
DUDE.
perfect fmily.
perfect marriage.
so they had to be perfect.
it was also big the public perceptions.
there's a lto of stuff about them.
yup.
Also he's charismatic as fuck, and a great public speaker. Which makes sense, because NASA knew these people were going to be celebrities when they came back so they needed to send people up who were going to shine in the limelight and be a great face for NASA.
true, but come on. at one point you have to look at earth from the moon and feel something.
An interesting mentality, not what you'd expect, but again, you wouldn't want to send someone up there who was going to get overwhelmed by the experience and lose sight of their training and mission and risk jeopardizing the mission.
man, that shits crazy.
when he got back from the moon, he said he didn't take time to process what he had just done, he just went back to work the next day.
he didn't really say more than that.
it was kind of weird though. Like, he began as a fighter pilot and was pretty much just a soldier and always did his duty. Going to the moon was his duty when he got on with NASA, so that when people asked him all these philosophical questions about it and more artistic questions, he just kind of brushed them off and said something like "it was our mission to go to the moon and I had a job to do so I did it".
speaking of number 2s i guess.
damn that sucks.
i just pooped at work.
He told this story too about how Buzz Aldrin was supposed to be the first man to walk on the moon. The lunar landing modules he said are super tiny and space comes at a premium, so when buzz and neil landed on the moon, buzz was supposed to get out first and then Neil. BUT, Buzz was sitting on the right side of the module, and the hatch opened on the inside and blocked him from getting out first. The hatch opened inside to the right, so that when it was open, the only way buzz could get out was for neil to get out first.
he made less doing that than most people make pooping at work.
pretty awesome though.
true.
to be fair, he didn't have to use his own rocket for travel.
People were asking Charlie if he got any kind of mega bonus or paycheck for his trip to the moon, and he told this hilarious story. So NASA doesn't do bonuses for any kind of trip like that back in his day, but they did have a per diem for any travel, which was 25$ / day in Charlie's time. So Charlie put a travel claim in for 11 days, which went Kennedy > Houston > Moon > Pacific Ocean > Houston, and at 25$ * 11 days, he was gonna get 275$ for his trip to the moon. BUT, since meals and accomodations were already provided on his trip those were removed from his per diem, and after taxes, NASA wrote him a check for $13.50 for his trip to the moon.
Thats awesome.

How much money would it cost you to just kill a random guy. Homeless, worth nothing to society. But you have to talk to him for 30 minutes first.
Someone play a game of doto with me.
This app will be the undoing of western civilization. Get on board Woody.
I would do that for about a thousand dollar.
Trillion dollars is a lot of money. The Iraq war only cost 1.6 trillion dollars and we took over a country and killed a ton of people. 
matt are you near a computer. can we doto right now.
Also, how's virtual yoyo coming along? I want 15% royalties.
Woody: trillion dollar app idea. A news app that highlights the top stories over a certain time period. I.e. something that shows me what's happened in the world over the past month.

What a time to be alive.
@Rich Homie Jon Drake and Future tape. Definitely bumps in the car. Jury is still out on whether its actually good .
And then after they go to college we tell him they are not also he is ugly.
What if we let him believe they are his children.
We will not provide mice contraception. The children's pain will add to the inner turmoil that this mouse will live with and eventual die with. 
Just before he dies, andy will look him in the eye and nod as if to say , "it was me all along" .
He will break. They always break. 
Also this mouse must be strong of will if he can handle living with Andy. I'm not sure heartbreak will be sufficient. 
I'm not claiming these are negatives, just discussing logistics. 
... Three mice, plus potential baby mice. Unless you're providing mice contraception. 
This of course means you will have two mice but you'll show that first fucker you meant business .
Lure it with a sexy mouse. Have that spy mouse work her way in with trust then marriage. Theyll live a happy life until you give her the signal to sleep with another mouse that you'll bring in. Torn and depressed, the original mouse you had will commit suicide. 
Ok macguyver.
No. Im gonna make my own trap with a spoon, a cardboard box, and peanut butter.
Andy did you set those traps to kill that mouse yet?
>CSI yeahhhhhh.
I'd say we... Kicked butt.
Kickball team, more wins, less butts.
Winning kickball though pretty worth. Now I don't know.
Leaving town not worth. Butts worth. If that wasn't clear.

https://apple.news/AsvE1VAXkShOmjeVqv1bekA.
also andy rant moar pls.
pls dont discuss details of the most recent one, i haven't watched yet.
end rant.
this episode, the tv shit was just for the sake of doing it. not only were the individuall bits not as good but they also had no tie in to the overall message the show was trying to convey (unless i missed something).
aka: life sucks, we may as well enjoy mindless entertainment.
like the goofy tv shit was not only funnier on its own, but also had a point in the context of the story as a whole.
plus when you think about how good the first season's episdoe was in comparison.
i thought it was as bad as the get shwifty episode but less quotable.
idk, i just expect more from the show at this point.
of those i only really thought the man v. car was any funny.
Eyehole man. The Siamese twins. The octopus guy. Personal Space man. Man v. Car show.
I enjoyed the Rick and Morty. More stupid Tim and Eric type humor.
rick and morty last night was meh.
So what is Brian doing now that he has passed the bar? Besides Dota.
#gif science.
I think it only looks for new Remind Me events every 15 minutes. This is @desrosiers 's domain though.
^I wanted to see if that would work.
#remindme "right now" congrats brian!
he can no longer sing 99 problems in its entirety.
Nerd.
Brian passed the BAR by the way.
you can't explain that.
also on had kills, deaths, assists and then some other number.
I like the thundercunt addition.
#oracle why were you not responding earlier?

is sUN really broken #?
If I was president I would just pardon and do favors for all my friends. I would not be a good president .
I did not netflix and chill with that woman.
Netflix and chill with president steen.
"Real Shit with Stu".
I want a president who will modernize the firesid chat.
Actually I retract that endorsement .
I swear to god I had the nuke codes in my pocket.
Andy for prez 2020 .
The more I think about this the more I realize this is what people already do.
America is awesome.
Bacon, amirite?
Dogs are the best!
If that app became popular I would become president and then say a bunch of non political things people agree with.
We're building it at work for a client. I like the idea.
You need sweet achievements though .
Good.
App concept: "Vote the Quote". You are presented with quotes from presidential candidates without knowing who said them. Strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree. After a lot of answers it shows you who you agree with.

What if instead of a person it was a letter?
I don't understand that question. Naked Erika?
Woody, if you got a gift who would you want to give it to you?
Not way better, but better.
I've gotten better.
Fuck yeah.

That girl wants your dick too much for you to not grab that chicks ass .
She wants you to grab her ass .
Mike. Grab that girls ass. 
Balls.
Andy isn't trying to close, but he should .
Update: mike and andy are trying to close so hard on two girls they like. Update 2: you guys can leave without me .
Andy. To make this up to me, send a picture of this chicks fits .

#oracle he grabbed my balls instead of her asscheek.

My old roommate Tom just got pulled over when in an uber and it turns out the driver didn't have a license. Uber gave him a $5 credit.
Thats a really good feature.
Also did you know you can connect Spotify to your uber and control the music? This shit is pretty sweet .
The uber driver asked me if I've been working out. 
Ended up deciding an uber was easiest / not too expensive. 
On my way. 
Andy what smell do you like best.
Andy, the thing you're most sensitive about .
Andy, social security number.

@Rich Homie Jon I can get lacrosse sticks if you brought zero.
@Ronnie Ma this is all of my computer stuff. Leaving town now. Schedule in taters. 
I have a pun for oracle but I won't tell it. It's unbearable.
Be there tonight to finish that up .
@Ronnie Ma this is the rest of my computer.
@Ronnie Ma 512 leaving work behind schedule.
Crowd sourcing. Clever. 
#oracle give me your best bear pun.
5pm on Friday means it's the weekend...
I won't .
You won't.
Woody give us the address of the place so we can have taco bell delivered to you and erica while you are there.
I remember taco bell had a contest like 10 years ago to win 1,000,000 pesos*. In the fine print they had *1,000,000 pesos = $77,000 .
Is that honeymoon money.
Also unibrow much?
Pesos aren't worth anything and feel like Monopoly money by his is why I've learned.
I'll put my plans for the Mexican strip club on hold.
Ok.
Woody go to my apt this weekend and make me a computer.
Leave work 5. Fart. Try to depart by 530 likely 545. Arrive at Vienna metro ~745 8.

not working today.
idk.
Andy why do your friends always try to go to the Lincoln memorial.
@Rich Homie Jon I dunno broski.
@desrosiers are you still taking the metro from Vienna.
@Andy Esposito ^.
Andy. What time do you work until today and also should I bring a sleeping bag like a homeless person. 
swing, miss.
#oracle why does the booty wiggle like a jello mold jiggle and why does it make me giggle? 
#oracle if I were to walk down to the lincoln memorial today and have a picnic, would there be ants?
Longer sentences / questions work better I think. More data to work off.
#oracle red rocket league.
Positive sign.
#oracle will you play rocket league with me this weekend? Jon is gonna be running in circles...
Using an old FEA package. Xp. Ie8. Active X. Java applets. This should be in a museum.
I opened an old laptop that ran XP last month. 
So around 2nd year was last time I touched Windows XP.
Late first year is when 7 came.
when did Windows 7 come out?
maybe.
5 years ago?
Open question: last time you used windows xp?

sounds like that russian train rode you .
wait, kidding Broncos play Chiefs tonight so I probably won't be playing games.
I rode a train over night from St. Petersburg in Russia to another town in Russia and got bit by bed bugs. Just another reason why Russia blows.
ill be on later too; also i thought bedbugs only lived in nyc.
Will be playing around 8:30-9 if anyone else wants in.
Im in the mood for a game of dota tonight.
But that's also a tall order. 
I have dreams in my head of throwing near a monument. Picturesque .
but thats it.
we could go to the national mall.
and dc in general is not the greatest place to lax.
its in DE.
haha, i do not have it at my appartment.
Andy do you still have your lax stick. Could be a prime opportunity to have a little lax catch this weekend. 
Ok I'm done. Proceed being serious .
Ask if you can also kick him in the dick if he's wrong. 
I did. It's Ez. Gonna file after wedding though.
look up the procedures for filing a claim in whatever VA's equivalent of the court of small claims.
Exactly. It's dead simple. They keep talking about "what's fair" and I keep telling them it isn't about fair, it's about the law.
you didn't violate any terms of the lease, they can't take your deposit.
Awesome. Awesome to the max. 
I feel called out. I wanna go in guns blazing.
alright, then you'll see them in court.
They called me out. I sent them an email saying "if we don't get resolved today then we'll get resolved in court" and they responded "we aren't changing our offer".
Ask to tar and feather the man as well in a public place .
My man.
i'm in.
And now I'm asking for the original extermination money too. So I'm asking for $1,000.
My old apartment had bed bugs right as I was moving out. I paid for an exterminator in my apartment. After I moved out my landlord informed me that they also had to spray for bugs in 4 other apartments and they would split the cost with me. This effectively took my deposit away. I said "no". Not my apartment, not my problem. They won't give me my deposit back. Off to court we go. Fuckers.
Yay.
Novel incoming...
We must make them rue the day.
Bring us up to speed.
Andy. Ultimatum reached. I'm going to court with my landlord. You gonna join in on the fun?

No one has dibs on the extra bedroom for YaR that know of.
I don't want a pizza. I'm going out to dinner with Erika.
>sorry.
Your mom has been around for a long time but gets used a lot.
its not my fault people use outdated modes of communication.
email has been around since the 90s.
I think your PA package sat in my mailbox for a month .
what year is it?
I too never check my mail .
Never mind he never checks his mail. The pizza would just rot.
Someday.
But with sausages.
Send one to Andy, he doesn't even have any money.
If woody responded to my question about Christans pizza I would've bought him a large special pizza. Take this as a lesson. 
@Andy Esposito Sammy b dibs'ed my couch like two months ago for homecomings.
@Ronnie Ma you keep on keeping on.
@Woody Zantzinger it was one pizza.
@Rich Homie Jon maybe giff address.

it's a nice place because you don't have a stupid fucking bathroom.
side note: does anyone have dibs on that bedroom for YAR?
it is a nice place because it has a bedroom.
Do you like Christian's Pizza.
But more than stu pays :(.
And probably way less than you city folks pay.

Also I hope you like money because that's what you're getting for your wedding by the way woody.
#oracle what do I deserve?

Andy can we eat at really great places all weekend. 
I love that trump strong arms the fuck out of everyone. Its hilarious to watch. 
Rekt.
The GOP debate last night was hilarious. My favorite part was at some point Trump turns to Rand Paul in the middle of the debate and goes, why is this guy even here, he's got like less than 1% in the polls .
Ez close on his part .
They did it in the Oval Office. Power move.
I think lewinski was pretty willing to take that Clinton D.
That was originally named after a famous porno at the time. So what you'd be doing is rebranding a rebrand. 
I'd pick Hillary Clinton. See how Bill likes a taste of his own medicine .
Remember the deep throat informant? We'd rebrand that too if you catch my drift.
Brilliant.
Actually I would do it at the watergate just so I could rebrand "watergate" to be about my scandal .
"Rapegate".
I'd have evidence. Rock solid evidence.
"First Lady accused of Rape".
I'd pick Michelle Obama. Imagine the scanda.
what if she raped you with justice beavers fist.
If I could pick, it'd be Ariana grande. 
Is that why? Selection issues?
thing is woody you dont usually get to pock the rapist; thats why rape sucks.
Sounds like me at 14.
jons new memoir.
"I'm sick of being a maiden , I hope I get raped".
but she prob isnt .
unless shes sick of being a maiden .
actually shes a maiden i take it back ; i do not condone rape .

So I guess I'll just play Dota alone all weekend.
Caaaaaannnnn doooo garyyyy .
Mike. You can also park at my place in Tyson's and metro in with me to save many dollars if you want. 
Baa-d.
I can do that. Its just annoying. 
not sure you can park at my place, although street parking could work. i assumed you were gonna just park at tysons and metro in.
Wow that was racist.

it could be pussy juice cam jeez or should i say jiiiiizzz.
My precious could be used a lot.
Holy fuck that is gay as shit.
next time lets just take notes on which scenes we think we could include with timestamps.
(/^▽^)/.
Everytime we watch it Andy and I swear we are going to make a gay version but always don't.
Ariana grande .
I refuse to acknowledge there is any other version.
Really?
The mouth of Sauron only plays in the extended version.
You play ball like a girl.
Woah.
Yeah take that.
Ok Mr Zantzinger.
Ok mr. I've seen the trilogy 10 times but don't know what happens in the second movie.
I'm still gonna go ahead and say you should have known that.
ah.
I thought you thought that was literally a gif of Saurons mouth. I didn't know there was a guy named mouth of sauron .
You could hang out with my parents in Chantilly.
@Andy Esposito  might run an audible and stay at your place friday night. My brother isn't gonna be in Tysons and I don't wanna stay there alone like i'm Steven Glansberg.
what did you think I was talking about.
To be fair rotk is a sloppy time.
Yes. 
I apologize.
Wait that guys name was "mouth of sauron".
No grills though.
That guys mouth was insane.
No no, it looks like the mouth of the messenger who meets gandalf at the gates of mordor with Frodos mithril armor .
Looks like the mouth of Sauron from rotk.
Wait. No.
Flash Gordon?!

How many people on a team?
You're progressing faster than me, you have innate ability to go get goals that isn't in my arsenal yet. You should definitely be on the offensive side for most of the 5 mins. 
I played some today, I'm getting better at them.
If we get better at competing for balls in the air, not just going for aerial shots on goal but the 50/50 balls, we could be really good I think. 
I've spent 3$ on worse.
Probably not worth it but it's $3.
And you get a couple new boosts tires and stuff too.
Jon I bought the 2 other cars for $3.
Much like friendship.
Also I have to announce in the group that woody is remarkably good at Rocket League with no practice or experience whatsoever .
I don't even remember what it sounds like.

Back in my day they said that https://v.groupme.com/13203822/2015-09-16T18:31:05Z/7ca4781a.568x320r90.mp4.
woops, for some reason I thought that was a thing people said. I'm not good at those.
>what hell.
> Scott clean.
nvm after some discussion the reason she left was 'No it was because she wanted to bring her AAU coach in to coach at tower hill and they wouldn't let her do that, so Ursaline did it' - unnamed source I just got.
To this day, probably the worst decision made in THS athletics. Best decision however was Justin and Hobbes burning that dick on the Tatnall field and getting away scott clean.
I always heard that the reason she left THS was that I think our athletic director, might've been still golding at the time, didn't want to let her play varsity basketball in 7th grade.
Elena Delle Donne won the WNBA MVP today.
That's really funny.

If nike was a person they'd lay down stacks of cash in front of you, burn it, then tell you to go fuck off .
Nike needs to go back to basics.

I'd say its because I'm a boss ass bitch.
I tried to watch a YouTube video and the ad is a 5 minutes long shot for shot remake of Animal House with the Oregon Football team?
Because that's essentially what it looks like when they run tests, cause it's still your blood.
But they can just say their high red blood cell count is from training at high altitudes .
I think they can detect that now. Using science.
Recommend blood doping, synthetic eurythropoietin can be detected but if you extract genuine blood from the athlete, store it, then re-enter the stored blood back into Athlete a few weeks/months later, performance increases.
Mmm love it when you talk dirty Jon.
medical nudez is like an MRI and X-Ray.
For science.
Nah just ask for noodz. Medical nudez.
^fuckin tryhard.
Fuck that. Do your best to research all you know on the topic and e-mail with something that might help. If he calls you out on anything just come clean.
I was gonna tell tree fiddy for da fun stuff.
Recommend anabolic steroids .
Recommend listening to alanis morriset .
tell him he needs more iron so he should go on a prolonged taco bell diet .
He is looking to me because he can't trust Nike doctors.
some guy from oregon mistook my UVa email for a UVa Doctor's email, and asked for my expertise on bloodwork to help out a professional triathlete.

Andy. I will be in VA Friday afternoon / night. Stay at my place in Tyson's corner that night. Then I'm gonna take the metro Saturday afternoon into foggy bottom. Have either lunch & / or dinner in DC (gonna be carb heavy) then sleep at your place that night. Sunday morning ill wake up at 6am or earlier then walk to the start of the race depending on how far away it is from your place (I'll look this up).

Ok, I'll see if there's anything specific on the books or in case law about security deposits.

I hit them with this "It is my understanding of the Virginia state law and US Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines that landlords are responsible for pest control.".
*disclaimer: I am not an attorney and any legal advice I give should be met with caution.
Sounds fun. Want me to do some basic legal research so you can throw law terms back at him?
Its like $600. I want it back.
Not my apartment, not my problem. I just gave them a deadline to call me and resolve today or we'll have to get the law involved.
Hmm interesting .
This is for the apartment.
because of pest control done in other apartments.
Won't return my security deposit.
What for?
I'm about to take my landlord to court. If that happens Andy you need to come to Cville and we will get hammered and do law.

You will be a great lawyer some day Andy. 
share a bunch of information so you do too.

For someone who was trusted with a lot of sensitive information, he liked to talk in detail about shit. 
turns out he thought you were doing a background investigation on him.
#which(ass, boobs).
Ass or boobs?
His wife is from Crimea. And he has two step daughters.

He went to Brooklyn university or college for fine arts. Then worked for the government .
Yes. It was a lot of that. 
he talked about being italian in new york.
i talked to him on the phone.
The guy doing the questions used to be able to give diplomatic immunity. He described a story involving Russian ambassadors that were giving him loads of free and awesome shit for it. Also other story's. He was actually kind of an interesting dude .
I want story details!
Warning though: he enjoys rambling and story telling .
He's a nice guy .

how does that compare to the cost of a slave back in the day?

is supply that large?
Right?
it costs $90 to buy a person?

in any case, the article you linked says a K2200 and a GTX750 Ti are roughly performance equivalent for gaming... the former costs $430 and the latter $120.
Sorry, lets 3D print a Graphics Card jukebox. A robot arms comes out and plugs in a new graphics card while software suddenly reboots with the new drivers.
yeah woody, old man got no imagination no more.
not with that attitude woody.
but in persepctive though, im going to get a new laptop from new work, so i dont need to make my home one do CAD.
Andy: no.
https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Can-you-game-on-an-NVIDIA-Quadro-GPU-604/.
my research says they are basically the same.
could you rig up some kind of duel graphics card thing, where you can switch?
my research says no.
and there are none that do both?
my research says that CAD graphics cards excel at crunching numbers, where gaming ones excel at spitting out images at 60 frames per second.
or is there something that gaming graphics cards have that's special?
so wouldn't getting a CAD graphics card be good enough for gaming?
my research says better drivers and different performance requirements.
nice*.
I think CAD graphics cards are just super fucking ncie.

I'm not sure that is right?

she'll never doubt you again.
and then boom, you've been taking lessons for the last 3 months.
And she'll say, "You're so full of hot air; you wouldn't even know how to operate a hot air balloon".
by that logic you should drive her around in an ice truck.
Here you go: buy a hot air balloon. "Baby you're so hot there's no other reasonable form of transportation".
This logic fucks .

Sorry dragos I wanted to rank up solo a bit last night, guaranteed playin with you tonight 😘 did you see that gyro game I had tho.
still interesting actually more relaxing but the paid heroes really makes unappealing to me.

the lack of hero items in hots really makes it a lot less interesting but a lot easier to play.

I'm in here because my cousin from NY is buying an apple watch and wants the tax free shopping. Also I'm blazed. 
Isn't the one in Christiana one of the largest in the country? It's the perfect confluence of circumstances: 2 seconds off 95 and no tax. They are printing money. 
Amazing thing to read and notice while in the store. 
There is a direct relation bishop between spacing between products in a retail store and profit on each item sold. Apple stores are so spacious, they only sell like 20 fucking things.

Also, if a lawyer audited our legal stuff I'm pretty sure we would be out of business in a heartbeat.
Do you even know apps?
How about the statute of frauds, aka, when contracts have to be written down?
>the implication.
Woody, do you understand the contours of offer and acceptance? Consideration? Implied terms (be they implied in fact or implied by law)?
ok i'll be your sock-em bopper clause expert. tag me in.
Em*.
You don't need a fancy degree to write contacts. Just write me up!
Law school blows.
Dont do it.
i now want to be a contract attorney.
so combat by sock-em boppers.
So as long as the combat was legal it would be fine.
To answer the illegality of trial by combat in an agreement: you can't put terms in a contract that would violate the law/courts won't enforce them.
oh cool #what will i utilize.
fuckin' posse got my back.
#what will I use in my trial by combat?
#gif panties judge.
you decide.
whoever loses the underwear first what? wins or loses?
mud wrestling; whoever loses the underwear first .
technically I don't think it's illegal?
how illegal would it be to include a combat clause in a contract?
Woody needs to learn to back up his words and contractual terms .
Trial by combat seems more appropriate here.
ez loophole.
he should've requested parley.
I mean, duh. 
Then Jon must being a fucking stud.
Reading is for nerds though.
Im not a lawyer yet, but I bet reading contracts is important.
If you're going to tell someone to follow the exact letter of a contract to bolster your argument, maybe read it first?
Clearly.
#gif contractual obligation.
idiots. Everywhere.
Me - "It is literally why we have contracts, we're sticking to it".
Them - "We shouldn't stick to closely to the contract".
Me - "Our agreement says we will re-estimate and you will pay more. It says exactly that".
Them - "How dare you. We need to stick to the exact letter of our agreement. We won't pay more".
Me - "We estimated the project, it is $20k more".
I'll replay the conversation briefly.

The animal jokes also have varying levels of subtlety. It took me rewatching some episode to realize how many times bojacks owl gf says "who".
it's almost hard to stay on top of the show because the characters are well-written, but then they'll just toss in animal jokes to trivialize it all.
i did really enjoy where mr. penutbutter went bankrupt because he listned to vincent's advice.
"i'm not a cowboy, I'm a cowman!".
i just love his "i went to the stock market. i did a business." sort of attitude. and the fact that he seems to be the most well-adjusted, human person on the show... while being three kids in a trenchcoat.
honestly i thought he was funniest in the beginning when bojack just constantly told princess caroline that he was obviously multiple kids and she just ignored him.
my impression is that he'll stick around, but they'll never "uncoat" him.
but no major plotlines probably.
so he may see minor parts.
I'm sure he'll make a return. Too funny. 
she broke up with him.
I'm super curious where they're going to go with Vincent. Such a hilarious and new sort of character.

if the child is old enough you can say that to the child then deny it to the parents.

im honestly struggling to think of notable canadian /bands/.
Best Canadian band ever pls nerf.

On the plus side, I just put on some rush. 
This is crazy.
Aui seriously won them TI5 by forcing bans that no one would have made.
more like nah doto.
3) na doto best doto.
1) Jon is also a punk, 2) I am sad to aui go.
i mean fear is a flexible player. towards the end of when rtz was with eg he switched to mid, but i truly think aui is one of the strongest 4s in the game.
i guess i just dont like rtz; i think hes a punk.
Dunno. Fear didnt feel like a pos 1 in ti finals at leaat.
having both sumail and rtz hyper aggressive might not be so great .
meh fear is a lot more stable carry than rtz.
Fear to pos 4, rtz in fears slot.
Check the link, roster is already a thing.
maybe they get big daddy?
I dunno man it's a different game up there.
aui's is more sad.
clockwerk bros unite.
aui was given no choice.
zai made a choice.
but it is.
I think it's good that he's young and aware enough to see that doto isn't everything.
i think zai leaving dota is more sad.
It's going to be a powerhouse team but sadface dot png.
:(.
Fear pos 4.
Fuckity feck fuck.

0/2, sOL.
#gif ass lick.
i guess team secret is reshuffling too with zai gone.
#gif big butt.
but it seemed like they worked that out by TI.
the only negative thing i ever heard about aui was that ppd didn't like how vocal he was in the beginning because that was mostly ppds role.
maybe it was auis fault; who knows.
he has to realize how valuable aui was.
and PPD isn't an idiot.
but EG isn't just a group of 5 members, its an organization with a manager who should be a cool head here.
in the end they are pretty young and immature ;  weird decisions are not that surprising .
but i really am.
its weird that i'm this upset by this.
i just don't understand.
but it sounds like zai is taking a break from dota.
zai was a package when rtz went to secret.
and who would be joint at the hip with rtz.
rtz replacing fear?
i just dont understand.
but that is so fucking stupid.
and for some reason it had to be a package deal.
ppd/charlie wanted arteezy back.
here is my guess.
they were actually one of the more consistent teams out there with that roster ; shame.
i want him on EG.
but still, fuck that.
obviously any team would jump to have him.
i mean yeah, he'll be fine.
well at least hes got some monies from the win.
i truly hope this is some kind of misunderstanding.
and as a fucking 4 position.
his naga and techies were so game changing that it forced teams to ban them.
the reason PPD was able to outdraft teams at TI was because AUI had 2 heroes that other teams just couldn't let him have.
i will actually be so upset at EG if this is true.
can they just kick some one off without reason? dont they sign contracts when they join a team?
he was pretty instrumental for their wins.

The pokemon may have been fake but my pain was all too real.
ez 99 rare candies.
best cheat was the Missingno cheat on the coast of Cinnabar island.

Yes.

12v12 is a completely different game than 10v10.
but this one goes up to 12.
need a totally new strategy.
Matt doesn't understand the impact or implication of amassing armies apparently.

it's 12v12 now though.
Guys we already made a 10v10 plan. The build an army plan.

Friendship and an actual gameplan op pls nerf.
snowball techies.
Snowballing sf op.

Glowballs literally never fails.
and glow ballz to mop.
Glowballs always works.
good point moke.
durable team to soak up.
Naga is a fish and has scales.
I think still dunks & glow ballz works well.
So being able to scale is important I think.
spectre would be good.
And if you survive you get a ton of gold.

You level up super quick because of the kills.
Matt is always right.
Matt is right.
It's not like regular XP being split 10 ways.
Bristle seems good.
I don't think you need late game.
I'm pretty sure in this game mode they highly accelerate the gold and XP you accumulate.
But you would still need some late game. What are some durable carries early that scale.
I'm guessing lvl 1 rosh is standard in this mode.
Yeah heroes that come online early would be key.

any big right clicker.
yeah ro Husk, Troll, Sniper.
Like a PA or something, so she could yolo for longer?
5 seconds is all it takes baby.
Who could benefit the most from that?
You have to remember that you have 5 extra seconds.
How do you kill that which has no life?
Not only for the other team but for yourself.
You ever play against that? It's 10/10 confusing.
No one ever dies.
Wraith king aghs.
Centaur aghs OP. Just run the other team over.
Good point.
no u dont.
Dont go all range. You need some initiators like sk or brewmaster.
just get a drow and go all auras range team.
Ok so you draft half the team to give damage buffs (lycan, troll, luna, venge beastmaster) and the other half AOE magic damage (lina, ww, ds etc...).
12 man vacuum.

has anyone ever heard of this?
the mathematics behind finding a set of 10 heroes with a certain item set to maximize the amount of units you could have under a team's control under any given time are far beyond any of us.
UNLESS you aghs morph on an enigma, and then got an extra 6 eidolons.
I was thinking morph Aghs could replicate a good clone hero and start making new clones.
Better than a morph.
that's an extra 6 units.
also, what about getting an enigma in there with eidolons?
In fact it would be way funnier if you just went up mid dominating ever enemy creeps.
man, with the new golems that split.
Plus you can dominate lane creeps for extra lolz.
There's enough Jungle, just everyone wouldn't get good creeps.
http://www.myinstants.com/instant/its-a-disaster-6mil-echoslam/.
buttz.
Also, what if there was an aghs on ES, so that there's two echos instead of one.
There isn't enough jungle to fuel this idea.
+50.
oh okay.
Lets be reasonable here Stu, Helms are expensive. Everyone already has to buy Manta.
why not +60 through helms?
so 52 Units through levels and skills +30 through Manta + another 20 through Helms.
Infinity is only limited by your imagination.
You can buy as many helm of dominators as you want on any hero already.
done.
just don't clump up.
even more if there is a creep wave.
6010 magic damage.
*20.
thats another 30.
If everyone bought Manta...
Imagine what the blackhole would look like.
It'd be hilarious.
I'd love to die in that echo slam.
52!
that would be a max of 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + ~10 + ~5 + 2 + 10! + 4 = 52 controllable units.

Maybe.
Wait who.
i assume that JOHN CENA could probably break a guys jaw.
i just dont think i could.
Excuse me while I ignore the advice and reasons that don't back up my preconceived world views.
to clarify, i'm not saying *someone* couldnt break a persons jaw with a single punch.
I did a really stupid thing to cause myself to fall off my bike.
I'm not convinced you're not just a klutz.
I broke my jaw when I was 10 because I faceplanted on to concrete from falling off my bike.
You'd have to be strong as fuck to break someones jaw with your fist in one punch.
I mean, I don't agree, but your research is appreciated.
<3.
Andy thank you for the most well reasoned response I could have asked for.
I do not believe I could. i once wound up and hit scott blaha in the face as hard as i could. he was walking into it and did not expect it. I will never get a better punch than that, and all i did was make his eye swell shut. pretty sure unless there is some special angle I may have hit him at, I do not think it would have broken his jaw.
heres a question woody and i were somewhat debating the other night: do you think, if you got a good wind up, and the other guy wasn't expecting it, and you didn't glance it, you could punch someone and break their jaw?
i ended up going 6-2. i'll take it.

But you might just poop clouds.
I'm going with Woody on this one.
It might.
no one expects the off-color poop.
I don't think the digestive system works like that woody.
send that.
then poop a white poop.
just eat a ton of marshmellows and raw flour so your poop turns white.
Or do what Moke suggested.
Get his address and stuff some Mayo and bread and chicken in an envelope so that by the time it gets there it had spoiled.
Then mail a bag of bones.
Say you'll mail him a fresh chicken salad sandwich free of charge to make up for it.
If we did it wouldn't have bones.
Then stopped because qa was doing a poor job.
Did you used to.
We don't...
I guess.
...do they think you guys make chicken salad?
How to respond?
"Good afternoon - I stopped purchasing your product sometime ago because I had felt that it had gone downhill and the quality just was not what it used to be I decided today I get some chickensalad and make a sandwich - first bite into it a bone - your price certainly has not gone down but the quality of your product is just disgraceful .".

To be fair, I didn't see that in New Orleans when you guys spent that whole afternoon watching it. 
Just watch porn.
Porn.
I dunno, Naked Dating?
Pls.
Jon I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
Reality television is something that I hate exists in this world. It's right there next to cancer, sex trafficking, and world hunger. 
Does he?
Mokes got a point.
I have to warn you that the crushing loneliness is not optional though.
Just be single and you can get fiber without cable.
8 Gigs maybe?
I am pretty happy with Comcast internet though, Dota 2 installed in 25 minutes.
I know you appease Liz with Berries and Honey but Erika requires Reality TV.
I won the high-speed internet by giving up the Cable fight.
pls join this century.
woody this is your fault for wanting cable.
For how much TV is you could buy like 5 Apple TVs in a year.
I'm ready to buy an apply TV and ironically be the zombies in their iconic commercial from the 80s.
I only use Comcast for Internet.

according to Comcast - The plan includes access to HD channels but its cost $10 extra per month to utilize them.

My HD TV doesn't come with HD.
Fuck. Comcast.
s4 has a sick play I saw. Involved pump faking the rp. If I remember later I'll link .
And he'll RP mid-skewer or forcestaff which is something I never knew you could do.
Yeah the whole pushing people into position to get a better RP is sick, regardless of whether its by skewer or force staff.
His force.staff plays are pretty nuts.
he makes force staff look imba.
Youre stupid!
"oh he messed up what an idio----oh. fuck.".

Very cool draft analysis.
Disclaimer: North American inhouse leagues have a rich history with a distinctive culture. Many games include friendly trash talk between players and/or spectators. Trash talk can often be vulgar. NEL is not for children. Except Arteezy.
also.
next time i get on lets stack and glow up some ballz.
i wish someone transcribed the video.
Road to TI6 dream is still alive.
EG probably figured cdec wasnt a threat.
No one busted out glowballs yet.
really? i wouldn't have figured that the big teams would risk scrimming and showing stratz after the end of group stage.
also, i didn't know that cdec and EG scrimmed a bunch together before the tournament, and even between the groupstage and the main event.
but yeah, being forced to first-ban techies and naga HAD to hamstring cdec.
turns out when you have a team of 5 strong players bans get hard.
also, all of cdecs first 2 bans targetted aui heroes and then the rest of their bans usually targetted sumail which is pretty funny.
watched last night, its pretty good.
i want so badly to watch that draft analysis but... work. feck.

Simpsons absolutely held up .
https://youtu.be/bQtmm_lpUKI?t=3s.
What! That was so specific and it got the notebook!
#gif feels like I'm wearing nothing at all.
#gif cat city.
Simpsons stood up. Show is hilarious!
sUN's out.
rise & shine.
#gif humping day.
ordering is risky, but I would include a few other shows in there.
I still need to watch bojack, and watch all the new rick & morty.
man can't believe I missed an animated show discussion.
#last.
Meh.
#gif big butt.
#gif butts.
No argument that it was good, and that a lot of that faded over time. But even when the simpsons was at its best it doesnt measure up. The important point though is that it isnt their fault. Every show that came after had the chance to look at what the simpsons had done first and improve. The model-t sucks compared to modern cars, but those cars had the chance to benefit from years of innovation.
Simpsons is probably the funniest show in the planet when they were in their prime. Seasons 1-10 are gold.
Also you suck.
If you think its really better than those other shows we're discussing nostalgia is clouding your judgment.
But so many shows that came after did so many things so much better.
Simpsons was important like citizen Kane but has aged just as well.
It broke ground.
Simpsons was historically important.
^wrong matt.
Especially because so many are so different .
1) Simpsons
Nothing else matters.
I know, its so hard to decide.
Oof ordering them is a risky game.
Although honorable mention to sealab 2021. Such a uniquely hilarious show.
I think my favorite animated shows in order are:
1. Rick and Morty
2. Futurama
3. Archer
4. Bojack
5. Bob's Burgers.
I think it rides the line of funny and deep really well.
But it is definitely close.
Wow, bold. Thats a hard call for me. 
Willing to say better than Archer.
Ok finally finished second season. This might be the best animated show since futurama.
Both times when he is getting kicked out of someones life who is close to him.
Because it was fucking real.
It turns out the less you curse the more impact it has.
And that (bokack) episode is only the 2nd time in the series they used fuck.
The last episode of rick and morty reminded me of bojack on the dark level.
"Go to bed, Penny".
Also holy God bojack is so dark.
Matt calm down god.
Jesus.

Also "I'm only looking for an answer, I'm not looking for judgement. Can you assimilate a giraffe?".

Woody doesn't love you like I do. My screen would've had the correct messages.

Do we not love you? Have not showed you that we care? Do we not remember laugher?
Why don't we play night crawlers.
Why wouldn't you share that with the group.
I don't know who the liar is.

Woody answer my text.
There's a cool down on certain (all?) requests .
#gif krusty krab pizza .
Haha they have pork belly never mind wassup son.
I hate whole foods.
Was hoping to see a topnotch butt .
#gif alpha butt.
But it would be cool.
That's probably not it .
They just wanted Alpha in their name so they could beast on some Beta small muscled bitches. 
Also to brainwash children .
Maybe they changed to Alphabet so they can be ahead of Apple alphabetically .
I think he's building a robot with sweets trap muscles.
its been a confusing day. Now we're throwing geometry into the mix. 
God damnit you and your geometry .

LAWYERS ASSEMBLE.
That's what I'm thinking Stu. We need the lawyers to chime in now.
I know dick about monopoly litigation so I can't tell you stomp.
Still pass go?
I'm not good at internet Stu so thanks for the link.
Avoid monopoly litigation?
Focus each company.
I mean I kind of see how it makes sense.
Most confusing corporate restructuring 2k15.
http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html.
God damn it Stu. You're gonna make me use the internet and shit. 
Google is only search now.
Giff link.
Google split up today.
Get yourself a hot cup of coffee we got more investigating to do.
Alphabet...alpha bet. Bunch of alpha men made a bet. A bet involving the lives of all their employees. 
#?
Is the case closed "?
case closed.
google is made of letters which are in the alphabet so google = alphabet.
I like anchovies in my Caeser salads. Also on my pizzas. 
it's ez.
Damnit sun you mysterious lady.
#what would help clear things up.
Equally as confusing .
I mean that was obvious. Don't be a dick matt. 
#what does Stu mean .

Is Stu a liar #?
Keep talking Stu. Ain't nobody got time to check what that means .
#last ez mmr.
... What?
They're Alphabet now?
So what's the deal with Google?
"I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked." "It's used to it!".
I love that episode. 
Leader of the planet Omicron Persei 8 wanted your lower horn. But you dodged. 
Also the guy in the bottom left of Matt's picture looks like the love child of dwight schrute and Clint Eastwood.
Shark attack.
What's the badass story you are going to tell the ladies?
https://i.imgur.com/rmdSxh.jpg.
awww.
k let's stop. 
how big would those boobs be. We talking knockers?
I like where this is going. Go on dragos. 
if my boobs grew id give you a taste.
Sry the doctor said I shouldn't aggravate it and I don't want to risk an infection.
so fuckin selfish matt.
:(.
No.
can i hump your leg matt?
Like a vagina. Your cut is a vagina. 
It usually hurts the first time.
I banged in to a fishing crate the other day and hit my leg right on the wound which didn't feel good.
Thanks keep me updated.
No superpowers yet but I'll let you know if any develop.
(see Reek).
Still better than your dick being chopped off.
Any usable superpowers out of it.
Like 90% healed. My foot gets stiff at the end of the day and I have a gnarly scar.
How's your leg now matt.
Want to play some doto in the meantime?
Pretty sure you'd love it woody.
I'm gonna rocket league to see what the hubbub is all about .
Also is rocket league happening? I can make that work.
I also loved polycomputing.
i dunno but it sounded cool af as i wrote it out.
Polycomputing the technological form of gang banging?
she's upset that brian's been so absent lately.
#who do you love?
idk sun is a jealous lover, im not sure she'd want you to be polycomputing.
When it comes to advice on computers, I'm going to trust the computer and not the pro athlete.
kobe and sun disagree.
how many laptops is the appropriate amount of laptops #kobe ?
thanks sUN.
is that a good idea #?
Just bring 8 regular laptops.
they're tough as shit and what we use when we work in the arctic. I didn't realize they're $5000 though.

I think it is a duxelles sauce, and chicken right? They have great crust though. 
woody, you report back here if you have any success at all in replicating the queen. Has to be the dopest dope i've ever smoked as far as pizzas go.

#gif butt science .
i dont care for it.
is this what work feels like.
apparently in 2005 they made a colelctor's edition that was 3d and looks super cool, but it goes for $1K on Amazon.
that's a great idea.
i feel like including little depressions around the edges that roads could fit into would be a nice touch.
Dunno but a3d settlers board sounds cool.
i dont know enough about painting to refute you.
but I also have no knowledge and have never done it.
i would guess acryllic primer and paint, and go to a warhammer store for supplies.
have we figured out a good way to paint on the 3d material?

so you're saying i should mime opening a door everytime i go into my bedroom, and insist on others doing so as well, and eventually a door will appear.
Fake it till you make it.
i should buy a curtain for my room so i can pretend it's a door. that seems responsible.

Woah mike.
ok i will click the second out of respect for you jam.
Also no, not on spotify I checked .
Ignore the first one. The song begins good but isn't really all that great after a while. The second one is better.
Are any of these on Spotify so I can continue to be a useless lazy human being.
Maybe someone might enjoy this too. Sitting back seat of a car on my way back from NOVA.

Next time you ask a simple legal question I'm gonna tell you to research it yourself.
If it's so easy, get to implementing. Service for sassy requests is service for sUN updates .
I barely have service.
Because if so then filtering those gifs out seems easy?
Answer your own fucking questions maybe.
Here is my question, do most of those gifs have the tag "3d text".
3D text gifs are so bad .
:(.
#gif hump pillow.
Butts?

I think secret has that design patented.

Ez same draft.
Techies meta god help us.
If it were a pub here teammates would flame the shit out of her "3 ganks and she still loses mid".

clockwerk, master baiter.
They were like "this is fine, I will sit here and wait for this to all blow over".
Dummies ate calldown.

If everyone who wanted to be there for this game were there, I don't think there's an arena in the world .
new angy is there it looks full.
Clock mvp.
Do we know how many people are in the arena? That crowd roar was nuts.

w/e cdec did to prepare for TI.
yeah, ppd even gave him credit after the winners bracket final.
I feel more nervous right now than I did taking my final this week.
Q is a very good drafter.
i think qop is good 1v1 vs clock so they may try to match those heroes up.

But ww and space cows ults go through.
EG red white and blue draft.

global silence isn't a targeted move so I think no?
Can you lotus orb off global silence?
xiao8 was way too penisy with that hookshot.
Gyro lesh cough cough also glimmer cape.
A few heroes need nerfs but overall amazing games.
Yeah the games I've watched have been so exciting.
Ok say what you will but this ti meta is pretty ok.
Although eg still have 2 tier 2s up so they wouldnt lose their whole base if they lost a fight.
Its still so close. One teamfight could decide this I think.
Nvm looks like he just died.
Fear has still yet to die this game.
excellent fight by eg.
Storm gyro and double silencer ulty is terrifying.
Still really worried about lgd's lategame.
Eg basically setting the pace with aggression.
Eg doing well but game is close.
Giff updates.
#gif tits are ready.
Really wish I could watch this on twitch.
Also means that storm can go bloodstone and still get pickoffs as if he had an orchid.
Yup. I'm worried for eg, the silencer pick is gonna make getting off a good black hole tough.
EG v LGD started, last day of TI boys.
In all serious though I'd be down to try it. It does look like tf2 though.
#sunstrike.
Well cam is playing it.
it has creeps?
Over watch is a new game genre, it's like moba meets fps.
dendi so sweaty  puppey so fresh and so clean clean.
Thanks reddit!!!
Marry someone who looks at you the way Puppey looks at dendi.

#move.
There are more classes but same idea. I think there's more to this game though.
Woody would play a good reaper .
than the tf2 weapons.
the character skills seem more diverse.
Tf2 by blizzard.
For the uninitiated ^.
https://youtu.be/dushZybUYnM.
ill play that.
Its suppose to be insane. 
A game I am excited to try is Overwatch. The blizzard FPS.
hey that kinda looks like cam.
#gif proud of you.
helps you grow; last night we got stomped,  we stomped , but cam brought his zen mode.
Dota is a thinking man's gamr.
My roommate played it. They are quicker games but just in general, I thought it was nothing. 
Its like a dumb downed version of dota.
That game blows. Not even kidding. 
He was describing the game they play and it sounded like dota so I had him ask.
Nerd.
Also he has friends that play heros of the storm.
Opposed.
Id be tempted to add him to this groupchat temporarily because it would be funny.
@BigBillz why you gotta be so salty bruh .
Classic billy.
Billy has refused to join though.
Alright waiting for my siblings and then running.
You really think someone would do that?
Just go on the internet and tell lies.
Who would do that.
Pretty sure mike is lying.
So say STRAVA INITIATE.
And it'll shut off automatically when you return home.
#gif technology.
But it's by voice.
You activate it.
You have to activate it.
So wait, do I just run and it tracks me automatically or do I have to activate something?
Typical Andy, running from everything.
Im gonna run anyway bitches.
Andy would you grow up already?
Excuses already Andy?
About to go run. Also there is some kind of storm outside.

I had to replay and screenshot this. Mike for snapchat MVP.
im farting black beans and tuna. is this what woody's life feels like all the time.
HYPE.
Ok I'm running tomorrow morning. I will download now.
Andy get a strava then run more so we can HYPE for you.
Mike, sUN is beautiful and you should be proud. Fuck the haters.
how dare you Andys sister .
#kobe how will she think about our awesome GroupMe .
That's the reaction I get from most women.

Oh okay Jon. 
Jon, keep posting pictures of attractive women!
this upper bracket lower bracket thing seems to be throwing you for a loop mike.
winner of that plays CDEC in finals.
winner of VG LGD plays EG.
I don't know enough about brackets to refute you.
PPD is gonna look at what happened, learn from his mistakes, and come back even stronger. plus he has so many VG games to study so they;re gonna be really prepared if they play them tomorrow.
i am still confident that EG have a good shot.
eg did get rekt, but they lost the ub at DAC too, and then came back to win the tournament by crushing their opponents.
2nd eg game was a moke rage quit.
Jon, whatever happened with that tinder girl you were messaging who was moving to hawaii?
EG got rekt.
couldnt keep his balls pumped.
Why is Brady suspended for 4 games.
truth kills jon.
VG v. EG hype tomorrow for sure.
vg is looking strong as shit.
rip.
I saved that photo dragos. Shit killed me. 
i wonder why this ti most games have not been close games just one team reking the other.
I am imagining Jon's face reading that and it is fun.
r/gentlemanboners .
Like is there a blog for this?
Jon where do you just stumble on pictures of these women?
Iceiceice though .
!!!
theyre not looking that strong.
I want EG to still win :(.
I want to see CDEC play EG in the grand finals, and I'll be happy with whoever wins that's.
Oh ok go America.
eg is not out yet.
EG still have losers bracket to go to.
Who do we root for now.
Soon.
That better be his wife.

Big breasts do not imply attractiveness. What if she's 400 lbs?

Plus he's got a family to support now and a wedding to plan. Dude needs the cash.
I'm rooting for fng and his sweet hair and cutoffs.
Ppd the salt lord will lead eg to victory.
Jajajajjjajajajja.
#¿ salto #?
^ :salty:.
Neither am I. I just pick good teams.
*Fair weather Fandy.
I've always been rooting for the white guys.
I'm not a fair weather fan Andy.
All the sudden though EG lookin like a pretty good pick huh?
You dont know the kind of relationship they have dragos.
sure hope his bride is not ez.
Ez bride ez lifr.
FNG currently engaged.
manta worth .
Wtf 3 self worths.
self worth is an illusion .
Cons: self worth.
If #kobe rolls a 6, Mike comes back to doto tonight.
Pros: doto.
Mike!!
I'm considering.
Moke pls.
moke dont starve yourself of doto.
shes righht.
Moke, jokes over, when are you coming back to doto?
#gif girls 4 life.
yuuuuus.
Dota4lifw.
No thx.
OK let's play hon.
HoN boys.
I mean yeah... Complexity.
Secret rolled over coL.
That's true. Their execution was excellent.
I haven't been overwhelmed by secret after the group stages.
vp played better they deserved to win.
New fave team.
Sick cutoffs on fng.
Wow.
EG all the way.
looking grim.
Secret pls.
s0-4.
�.
s4.
i dunno man i've seen jamp.
Zai and fng are the prettiest girls in dota.
1-1-1-1-1.
what positions did VP play their heroes.
I just want fng to win.
this doesn't look good for the side i assume we are all rooting for.
A 1millisecond blackhole.
and get walkie talkies.
or we can all do meepo.
You won't.
Do it.
i kinda want to do the wisp costume and make neato LED balls.
And a total babe.
she's like infinity feet tall.
Watch out sheever.
and hunt booty.
gonna go as booty hunter.
I _actually_ think I'll go.
Haven't seen yet, but that'll be me TI6.
is there an enigma-guy in the audience.
black HOLLLLLLLLLL.
Man that guy rocks.
Can we talk about how cool enigma is?
couple beers deep, watching dota, feeling complain-ey.
what the fuck sense does it make that he does infinity damage early.
also gyro's fucking rocket barrage.
Planet erf since berf.
Erf.
and even if, urf.
unless you have a silence _early_ he's god.
its just ball, that's the everything.
That shit is way too spammavle, which would in turn nerf overload.
Or they could increase the cool down on static remnant.
Yeah. Overload is crazy.
go fucking cry with tinker in the trashcan.
its the stupid fucking damage on overload.
Him and terrorblade on the sidelines.
Gg never picked again.
-1 base armor.
i would not cry if storm got nerfed.
Unbalanced thunder goat.
balanced lightening horse.
Lesh 100% ban rate in the main event.
Hes super hard to use, but in the right hands hes unstoppable.
i haven't even _seen_ lesh get played.
It's just how he can split a team or isolate a player.
lesh will defo get nerfed so he's not 1p/1b.
i guess, but he's not 1p/1b but his impact is crazy.
They could reduce the range on ES stun, or at least the duration of the fissure block.
 Lesh is getting nerfed. I say they increase the cool down or mana cost on his lightning to reduce its spammability.
prolly not.
i wonder if they'll nerf ES after ti? i think wyvern will get one 4 sho but ES's range is bonkers for stunz.
Yeah ez money.
wow gifted that rosh.
this game is a bloodbath.
Still tho.
Last pick enigma.
did they first pick engima? bold AF.
Secret won game one.

#who will help Andy.

gotcha, who is near philly.
bring a really stinky sandwich with you as well and eat it mid interview .
I think it only works in a dual interview.
should I do that as well?
I'm on my way to an interview.
"I thought this picture of Mr Jenner would speak to my dedication and hard work".
that he faked an autograph on.
"is this picture of bruce jenner your resume?".
Jon's resume is probably just a picture of Ariana Grande.
And then I assume just a picture of ariana grande.
;).
also playing with his nephews.
Also Snapchat.
Jon's hobbies section: �.
Ha-ha ok well played.
#sunstrike.
I dunno.
You did so badly I assumed you only considered education a hobby?
Think for once in your life Woody.
Why would uva be in my hobbies section.
Ez .
#best country.
work history too.
also probably that you graduated from UVA, college is important.
Jam pls I'm blushing.
also 'being a great friend' and 'being handsome'.
If I had a hobbies section on my resume, thinking of euphemisms would be on there.
jewels. nice. 
Panties would make my jewels less free...
because they're very comfortable and allow your dingus to be free.
no no no, Canadian men wear panties. 
Canadian women > American women.
you guys wear panties. 
They're probably so bad because their water is always fucking frozen .
#what makes Canada better than America?
Yeah get better at water sports.
#what would make Canada more free.
😂.
are you enjoying freedom? because america invented that.
ya it rox.
Like your entire life scrub.
How un-American of you.
Look at Jon! Using the metric system!
Let's road trip to Matt's house and ruin it and then declare victory.
Mike, make a machine that slowly lowers a knife into Matt's chest. A centimeter at a time. 
This stings.
Guys we just got you won't'd.

3old5me.
Old enough to probably have a grand daughter. 
Woody.
Define "old".
No, I was like 'aha...alright, I'm gonna go over here now'.
"I bet your granddaughter is hot".
Did you compliment her back, Jon.
Maternity leave I understand,  PTO no way.
An old woman called me sexy at the gym today. It was a very uncomfortable experience. 
Thank you. WillowTree is thinking about putting in unlimited PTO and I went on a huge rant against it.
It feels like you have to ask permission for PTO... Which ruins it.
^^this is my life right now. It sucks. 
so you wouldn't feel guilty or potentially shamed for taking PTO?
wouldn't you rather have a high but fixed amount?
You obviously can't take PTO everyday forever, so you don't actually have unlimited. Which means you have some vague amount of PTO which means your employer could always be second guessing the amount of time you take off.
Unlimited PTO or Maternity leave is horseshit.
#gif numbers.
That gif is nuts.
I only like my phone numbers in imperial units.
#gif God.

10 Commandments, 10 digits.
Ten numbers the way God intended it.
thats too many. give me a couple good solid american digits any day.
most european phone numbers have like 20 digits.
probably an international number.
like whether its a phone number, a gps location etc...
is there any service that takes strings of numbers like that and then tries to make a best guess as to what they are?
Or some kind of secret code?
who the fuck knows, at least put some ( or . or - in it.
International?
it looks like they just jammed numbers at me.
that doesn't look like a phone number.

>[Piercings] are like any body art, they're great when done tastefully. I think that [some piercings are] too much, but the[y can be] excellent.
Thoughts on piercings?
I think that tattoo you posted is too much ink for anyone to have on their body but tons of people would disagree with me.
That's fair. But everyone's going to have different opinions when it comes to this kind of stuff. It's all subjective.
I don't know if I like any tattoos on a girl. That is unless, of course, she's really hot. 
*out of .
A southern belle type girl would be put of place with a tattoo .
Tattoo has to fit the girl .
I dated a girl with a sweet fish tattoo on her arm. She was already super cool and the tattoo just added to it.
^agree 100%.
Tattoos are like any body art, they're great when done tastefully. I think that tattoo is too much, but the quality is excellent.
To me, this is a lot for a girl.

Rightly so. Still worth a try just in case its a different chain or my friends and I didn't get good ones. Original idea.
and yeah i was skeptical when he told me about it.
there is some place in dc that my friend was telling me about that does it too.
Sushi is a one bite affair .

It's hot. Beach good. Bikes good. Pissed off my sister but that was bound to happen anyways.
No big complaints. A bit hungover. Going to a concert later. Probably gonna have to stay a bit late at work.
How's everyone else's day?

"Is that a hero".
There was a doom in the game Matt linked. I was briefly confused.
Fuck that noise.
I'm not sure if it was that game, but there was one huskar game where mike was insisting I get a bkb.

I like Dota .
Brian sleep in to black hole.

We were down 22-2 and I was enigma.

Was this "the game" http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1384792587.
Brood mid!
You should've waited for the second message .
I opened at work.

It was a pretty hilarious interview .
When I went to that conference in Finland, I was presenting some government data and was given a rundown by one of the higher-ups on espionage and stuff to look for and little security measures to take.

Hey everyone, you ever played that game where your pornstar name is your government ID code?
Q: can a hurt heart love again.
Q: how does space work.
This has been a long con specifically for that purpose.
It was for naval research labs... NASA before they were cool.
Basically had to talk about the groupme and guarantee you never tried to coerce state secrets out of me.
Stu what was the security clearance for? Are you working for NASA yet?
There are no wolves in wolfville. Good job, place-namer.

I tried real moonshine once. Evaporated on my tongue before I could even act.
Oh I want to get technical.
bacardi breezer = solution.
moonshine = compound.
well that depends on how technical you want to get.
Alcoholic beverages are actually compounds, not solutions.
*drinking solutions.
Or drinking problems?
Did you talk about the drugs?
Was it because we're all in the same groupme?
yes I actually said something similar.
Did you tell them ducks rule?
wat.
had to talk about matt and dragos for like 15 minutes.
just had a 2.5 hour interview for my security clearance.
i really like these profiles.
aww fng seems like a nice guy.
Write "¿salty?" Whenever possible.
really solid advice.
she said her best advice for any new player is "stay focused and don't get angry".
she should say "get rekt scrub. ez mid".
noob.

She said her dad taught her how to play and now she beats her dad and says stuff like "that's how you do it" when she wins.
Anyone else watching this?

#gif broken heart.
i had so many gifs i wanted requested, so many questions i wanted answered, so many things i needed ranked on a scale of 1 to 10 by an NBA legend.
please don't hurt me again.
life was rough on the outside.
brutal.
#gif welcome back.
Desrosiers added Andy Esposito to the group.
He won't make it on his own.
Let's bring him back, it's a cruel world out there.
4) how long should we make andy sit out in the cold haha.
3) i have a desk but i use it for hobbies and such mostly. working from home is stupid.
2) i just watched the highlights of that fy rubick game. holy fuck. some people are good at doto.
1) rekt.
I give you a 3/10 for question clarity.
you should've specified personal desk rather than work desk.
I give you a 3/10 on helpfulness.
Also has one of those holes in it to put your cords through so they're not just sitting on your desk cluttering it up.
But it's big and has nice drawers and is a mahogany colour.
Um, it's my work desk, not sure where it came from.
Where did you get it?
Go on...
I've got a good desk.
Who here likes their desk? I don't have a desk anymore.
comments are hilarious.

#gif sexy boot.
I think I got booted once.
without*.
has anyone other than andy ever been booted?
^ that is what he has become with the GroupMe .
#gif Andy.
I think an hour is the longest anyone has ever been booted.
I remember something a bout a guy who studied law and was really in to boobs, i think his name was ben or ryan or something.

Desrosiers removed Andy Esposito from the group.
#¿de sal?
Taste the sad andy.
lol.
Andy Esposito has rejoined the group.
Style points.
Andy Esposito has left the group.
peace bitch.
I'd take it personally if you left Andy.
thats hilarious. pretty sure fear was the closest to arteezy of the members of EG. from what i can tell he didn't take them leaving as personally as ppd did.
like, absolutely incredible.

Maximum high.
I'm so high right now.
#gif 3d drugs.
just the right amount of business.
but then again they aren't the lazy french.
they aren't germany who is all business.
Argentina does medium business i guess.
#gif medium business.
can you 3d print us drugs?
hey mike, did you hear about the 3d printed pill to treat epilepsy?
#gif minimum business .
#gif serious business .
#gif maximum business.
Ez business.
https://i.imgur.com/pIn1Qdv.jpg.
but I feel like ti4 was an inflection point. It allowed the elite teams to actually commit to playing dota full time without reservations for the first time, and it's showing now. the skill cap is way way up. just like any sport, there's that turning point where shit gets serious.
ti5 is so awesome to watch, not just because of production and the meta is pretty great right now.
made possible only by c9.
just watched the highlights from the vg c9 game, what a fuckin' thrill.
#gif sexy pajamas .
#gif batman.
FY is putting on the best rubick performance I've ever seen.
If you guys are missing this VG v. C9 game, you're missing the best game in the tournament.
Absolutely incredible.
FY is the best player in the tournament.
You wanna get fried chicken cheap beer a game cube and some lube.
I would go to hang out with Mike, but that's it.

Hey Jon do you want to come.

Nope.
hey...no invite to the nerd convention for your good friend jon?
Be on in 5.
Thanks bud.
And/breathe heavy.
Well ticket prices are going up so now or never. Also courtney wants to come.
I'm a strong medium on it. Let me get back to you about it, which basically means I'm going to forget until two days before you come down.
This month.
#what month.
Of what month?
We can just do like a 1 day thing too if you want, not sure how much that is.
28-30.
When is it.
Woody and mike, if I buy tickets to omega-con in cville, do you guys want me to get them for you? Its $55 for a weekend pass.
Nubs.

Driving home, who's winning game 2.
So fuck off sUN, just cuz I don't put out for you, you hypocritical bitch!!
Proud that mutiple(many) women think I have the qualities they desire in a man to sleep with him.
Ez.
#whores.
'all i do is win win win no matta what'.
Aggro decks that just involve emptying your hand as fast as possible are not actually that fun.
dragos, get on skype. I'm on a 10 win arena run, lets do this.
yo i hate you.
Cooking update: still cooking.
yo aggro paladin is so fucking fun.
Guarantee they'll ban storm thsi time.
>tar getters.
4 single tar getters.
Everything's commin up eg.
Draft was dumb.
That is absurd.
Ehomes storm rekt them. They went from a 10k advantage to a 20k deficit.
Yeah dude.
Holy shit are you serious .
lol.
They lost it.
Is secret losing game 1?
A man after my heart with the fishdicks message .
are u guys watching secret imploding?
Also Liz def couldn't text woody directly.
Will she go on a murderous rampage if the salmon isnt served with berries.
eh you better get some salmon.
salmon most likely.
Also it's seabass.
Also tell Liz she'll eat what we give her and be grateful.
Fish dicks.
Woody, what kind of fish is at your wedding. Liz wants to know.
1) fuck storm spirit, 2) fuck wyvern.
D I G I T A L F A I T H S.
Muslim apps 2k16.
Turned to the Muslim faith, woody did. 
On sandwiches and burgers its cooper sharp all the fucking way (thanks Mrs. Zantzinger) .
#what did woody actually do that he is so hype about.
Manchego cheese is the shit. Also a big fan of Dubliner .
^ what Maple meant .
Prosciutto and manchego sandwiches with homemade garlic aoli with roasted Brussels sprouts .
woody eat something.
#what else?
breakfast for dinner.
#what should woody do to celebrate.
Woody in a good mood is the best .
I still feel on a roll. Moving to champion beers.
All of those things I do in fact like.
Both!
i love the office too which one more the british or american.
Bad basketball teams.
Stu.
HeArthstone.
The office.
Things Jon likes: sexy women.
really well played. 
still a huge fan of that Asian girl gif. 
zai has to be having a ball.
god what a dream game for a space cow.
Andy you feeling a little.
That's actually confusing. What is there to miss?
That joke went full steam ahead, no reservations.
Too ez.
harsh.
thank.
I've seen Andy and Liz together. Does that count?
you can think annie.
Man the bear joke might be the one we've gotten the most mileage out of, ever.
Have you guys seen train wreck?
this phoenix = lrn2ult scrub.
yeah, the humor was lost on her bear brain.
Andy and I were watching a bunch of those videos with Liz. She was 10/10 confused.
DEET DOH DOH DAAAAH.
DOO DAAH DOOT DAAAAAH.
Are you ready?
Is champ there?
#gif john CENA .
Technically my right hand has probably seen the most Asian action actually. 
CENA.
Jon.
That Asian?
Ever.
I also did once. Then I never stopped.
would recommend.
i hooked up with an asian once.
surprisingly not me .
cant help it when jons around.
there's a decent amount of yellow fever in this groupme.
Everyone likes Asians. What's not to like?
👲.
my wood likes asians too.
Lol woody likes Asians.
too fuckin ez.
Even Comcast isn't bringing me down.
I'm riding so high right now.
Spicy azn.
That was in fact a hot Asian girl.
RTZ mid.
That's wassup.
Ok dragos.

#gif hot asian girl.
Dang.
#gif mraw.
#gif skeletor.
Spacecow zai.
asian girl in booth behind puppey is hot.
So I'll have some swag to share with you guys.
I also just gave someone going to TI tomorrow $100 and told him to bring me swag.
Woody knows how to celebrate.
🙌.
Gonna make a sandwich to celebrate.
High fives all around.
Boom just closed an app deal.
Secret ehome.
Yeah, draft is almost done.
Just one game jon.
Is secret playing?
I wish I wasn't in the god damn gym right now. 
So sick.
Sick.
Secret come out wearing sungalsses.
lol that secret entrance.
Fear is so stoic.
He is actually a really great guy. Good job fear. 
Fear is a nice dude. Interviews really well. 
true. even if there is some small chance.
I get it I guess. Its the international. 
Universe is awesome.
so i guess col are just gonna refuse to ever gg before a team takes their ancient.
What a stomp.
Did you guys see the sumail remnant into blink double dodge. 
Nvm.
Nvm.
Dieback!!
universe went lotus orbe instead, lol.
Wait a second.
8-33, just throw in the towel boys.
And a better friend .
Dragos, you're a better dazzle than this guy.
i wanna see him kick someone.
i hope universe gets aghs.
This game is pretty embarrassing .
they should probably call gg.
But thank god I have no reception. The message didn't go through. 
Holy shit. I'm texting that girl and I accidentally wrote "this timber blows ass".
good item.
Like, always.
Someone always has a medallion .
they still managed to win because ee, who was standing in, carried on luna.
he once fell so far behind on ember that he had to go ghost scepter.
*rtz's.
rts's ember is infamous.
lol, not at ember.
still though, RTZ > Sumail .
He's good at the slight searing chain combo. 
Sumail*.
Symbol is ridiculous.
bye bye Complexity.
My gawd.
like stopping to have a smoke while you're slowly stabbing someone. 
Like, what the hell dudes.
the fucking pause to buy shit at the secret shop.
Complexities positioning is crap.
omg.
lol ez .
making Crystal Maiden look like a boss ass bitch .
PPD. 
Sumail is just running around at this point .
euls is all you need .
shes good i like playing her as support.
lina just isnt that good of a support i think.
col 2 greedy.
Welp. Looks like EG wants my fatass to go to the gym .
just paste a picture of sven there.
#kited.
he must be buying everything.
its absurd that ppd is still lowest on net worth even though he's farming the jungle on CM.
Brian >.
i think storm is still his best, but he definitely plays a good ember.
I've never seem him play ember before.
yeah he's in his comfort zone.
Sumail is playing very well.
My thought process would've been, "fuck runnnnn!".
^.
you were pretty good at knowing when to go in on pa.
its just understanding the limits of the hero you're playing.
The coherence to know that he wasn't in any trouble with flame guard on and to turn back toward two heroes during a gank is the higher skill level stuff I don't have. 
The LSAs are on point.
I hope complexity evens the series so I don't have to go to the gym yet .
Big stuns.
Dank memes.
LOL at the signs.
The dude with the 'pick riki, no balls' sign lol.
TIMBERRRRRR.
i like dk offlane .
Teams like Dragon Knight .
Oooh razor.
Incoming TA pick?
Team buff armor.
techies + tusk too stronk.
its always the team without the tusk that bans techies.
Techiez ban again.
They weren't .
Those must have been some tiny turds.
They took a shit down their tear ducts .
Those tactical pauses worked.
yes.
Who won, EG?
the disrespectful epicenter .
gg half a second before throne dies.
Universe is so clutch.
S-stop is the most disrespectful shit we do.
It'd be fun to be a dick now. Deny aegis. S-stop on Effigies .
GG.
Their inexperience is shining through.
they could probably have even done an aggressive lane.
PPD is insane .
they deefinitely needed to put more pressure on fear.
Octarine is such a bad pick.
Or an orchid.
If complexity got a sheepstick this game would be so different.
ez game.
they hit the time and boom.
eg had a timing where they were really strong and they didnt fall too far behind.
can't believe how much this game shifted .
G fuckin G.
THAT EPI.
UNIVERSE.
he has a pics with seals and nephews.
� no.
show us jon.
Game on!
which was ironic after judging literally hundreds of women.
Because he's a bitch.
jon wouldnt show us his tinder profile.
Because you should change it to that.
Jon, what's your tinder tagline?
maybe hes mom is on smth ... like hallucinogens .
Hilarious ^.
http://www.clickhole.com/article/we-challenged-man-survive-minimum-wage-and-he-imme-2028.
this would be a great online dating profile.
"Hey this guys mom is onto something".
> Hey, this guys mom may be on to something.
that is something i would think of .
Clickhole is so good.
^ I thought that was hilarious .
jon i love this.
http://www.clickhole.com/article/6-pictures-me-i-really-hope-make-you-say-what-hand-2814.
the director had them shoot the explicit sex scene for hours.
That's probably why you don't direct films jon.
"no no no, kiss her like this...".
thats what happened in blue is the warmest color.
If I were the director, I'd make them retake that scene like 10 times.
They're coming back to their booths.
oh fuck yeah.
black swan.
#gif hot lesbian.
http://www.clickhole.com/article/science-ftw-researchers-taught-gorilla-sign-langua-2805?utm_campaign=default&utm_medium=ShareTools&utm_source=facebook.
Yeah, its been like an hour.
are they still pause?
I usually love watching cringe stuff, that was tough for me. 
what is gojng on with the game.
I want that 10 minutes of my life back.
The whole thinf.
Jesus Christ that was brutal .
matt. did you watch all of that.
do we know wtf happened to the game.
Its a trainwreck.
Still watching.
I dunno if I can take this .
i dont want to know.
dont even describe it to me.
jesus.
but obviously freeze mage just sucks against warrior, its the single worst matchup in hearthstone.
Andy. some guy just started singing into the mic .
omg.
dragos, you are describing fatigue/control/giants echo mage.
i know.
Andy you would hate this.
i turned it off.
so much cringe. is everyone watching this shit. 
i thin a molten freeze would be a lot better.
the prob with freeze mage is you have no minions to chip away at his armor.
but occasionally when you do it feels so good.
These nerds are so fucking cringe worthy.
as someone who plays freeze mage, those games are so hard to win as the mage.
True.
i dont think the card would be included in many decks though jon because it would only be good against warriar and maybe freeze mage.
some games the armor gets out of control becomes impossible to win.
it would give them a chance.
Warrior would be very difficult if that's the case.
as a mage spell?
do 5 damage to the opposing hero, ignore armor.
one that does damage through armor would be strong.
wtf is an alexstraza?
i wonder if theyll put in a card that strips all armor away.
i think i ended the game with over 30 armor.
he used all his burn on my shit, and then conceded when i gorehowled his antonidas.
sad mage.
haha armor ftw.
eziest game of my lyfe.
I need to put in some owls to get past belchers and stuff but otherwise, it just murders so fast. 
although earlier i cued as a control warriar against a freeze mage.
hilarious rhymes cancerous .
yeah, all my games are against face/midrange hunter or aggro pally.
That's what I've been playing lately. Its hilarious. 
Wait I also didn't realize we were taking about aggro pally. 
radiance op.
just the tiniest bit of magic damage would finish off everyone.
yeah what i said would actually be a trash ult.
Blocks all physical .
wait i dont remember does ga block physical or just prevents you from being killed by physical.
Its a strength hero .
The hero is pretty tanky, you can walk up pretty far. 
i keep my supports pretty far back.
i think for me omnis hardest thing is the short range .
But dazzul.
With anger and a short fuse. 
Okay, we try tonight. I will teach. 
i can practice my omni more just so we both can do either .
jon we should perfect an omni venge support duo.
Totally.
Maybe an offensive swap with the omni venge mix would instead add the wave of terror minus armor to the swapped enemy .
unlike face hunter for example.
the only redeeming factor is that if you manage to get board control, then its super hard for them to deal killing damage.
yeah its so fucking annoying.
also unrelated i fucking hate the aggro pally.
i would prob not be worth her spit .
Maybe you just need a girl to spit on you and call you names. 
im doing it again.
thats prob why i cant talk to girls and also lose at life.
i enjoy self deprecation maybe too much.
dragos with the self burn.
keeps your core from having to farm one.
redundant with my butt.
you just get blink on venge and then swap in an ally to the enemy team.
your face is redundant.
usually if you swap them theyre safe.
and its redundant.
but then you cant use it offensively.
 wait.
The venge omni mix ult would be once you swap, it also GA's just that hero .
matt tell em : respectful canadian RAGEEEE.
Yeah this is ridiculous. They have a whole year to prepare.
is that too much to ask?
i just want to procrastinate and watch dota 2.
jesus this is obnoxious.
Aaaaaaand twitch is down for me.
Sweet hair tho.
This dude with the man bun thinks he lifts a lot .
How would the ult work?
A combination of Venge and Omniknight though sounds awesome. 
Sounds horrible .
so you won't play him?
Zet, arc warden. Hes like meepo and techies combined .
and big clothed barely breasted women.
Zet you say.
Still need Pitlord and Zet.
and big breasted barely clothed women .
Nah.
Guys it was earth spirit in captains.
More fireworks.
big tittied women .
plus if they did it perfectly, what would they improve on next year?
they were so close!
We let them down.
Needed 61 million.
was 60 million not enough to get decent computers?
why is this still paused?
+1 Jon point for sincerity from the butt chin man for talking about his lack of knowledge and still love watching dota .
^ 😂.
I don't know enough about salmonella to refute him.
you dont know enough about medicine to refute me.
andy that isn't how it works.
which have salmon.
because jewish people eat lox.
he might suffer from salmonella.
I think you'd be OK, Israelis are a natural clean and STD free people.
Get your junk checked out after that Stu. 
Wow.
All of israel!
#what would sty do?
I would do several htings to have one of those.
Omg this faceless rec.
Great use of scuttle.
you can blame it all on me!
baby come back@!
woody noooo.
I'm scuttling back out of the convo.
�.
yea.
Ah.
Read mikes question woody!
and delay the dagon.
Rubick with a stolen blink, refresher, blink dagger, and force.
itms are just fluff.
puck only needs his skills and blink.
euls too maybe if we count elusive as mobile.
i was thinking puck with force blink octarine.
woah Andy this boat info is good stuff.
^lol.
Other than storm maybe Anti-mage with blink, refresher, force staff.
storm with mana regen items and bots.
q: what is the most mobile hero and itemset you can make up.
hex woulda been good though, i agree with matt.
honestly though its the ult.
moar blinks, mobility op.
30 sec ults.
So stupid.
Why the fuck did qop go for octarine?
first game still going, eg just pulled ahead a bit.
oh ok.
cant watch.
First game still happening.
i have lots of mice to disect .
eg won first?
#neat.
its like forced rental in emergencies.
but if they damage something they have to pay for it.
in an emergency you have to let people come onto your land.
they won.
they sued.
they crashed.
he said "fuck you guys".
these people were on a boat in a storm and tried to dock on some guys dock.
go on.
did you know "any port in a storm" actually has legal precedence.
Just crank one out and then you won't for an hour. Rinse and repeat. Ez. 
my sister in law was saying today that it would be nice to watch the upcoming rainstorm from inside our house's porch. i said, "it doesn't really matter if it's this one, could be the neighbors, could be across the street." "why," she asked. "well, any porch in a storm".
I miss it =\.
<---- this butt Jon.
sUN is following the game because she's *in the computer*.
sUN knows.
damn right.
#who isn't?
^ yo, that butt is still fuckin awesome .
Caught me.
#who is worried?
Tactical pauses.
#gif spooky.
FEAR OP!!!
i turned the game on and suddenly eg is just WAHABAM.
EG EG EG.
i was never even worried.
Wtf coL.
Holy shit.
OMFG.
OMG let's go fear!!!
and its really nice to know that people aren't wasting that.
i read somewhere that he's bisexual and has orgies.
and all the rest of this is just compensation.
what if he had like a comically tiny dong.
Hes a superhuman.
I bet Ronaldo's life is insane. Its insane that someone can be that athletic and that god-like handsome .
awesome perks of getting to be a pro athelete.
#gif sploosh.
My friend's ticket .
Either way...nice. 
Is that Kate Hudson?
sploosh.
#gif a pretty girl.
phew.
#?
its been like 3 weeks, you think he's okay?
oh fuck i forgot i left joe back there!
#what is weighing on andys mind.
give andy 5 dollars.
>can I do learn how to read.
what does that say guys.
also woody. he will know when kight rider is playing.
#what can I do learn how to read .
Finally Jon can understand what is going on.
it even shows the heros moves.
also, how cool is the twitch feature showing the players and heros?
agreed.
Lame.
paused.
Why is the game not on twitch.
The clinkz needs to try and find Fear and kill.
fuck you QoP.
Holy balls man, pure damage from clinkz .
#Quien .
#¿Que?
viva mexico.
i think eg is still in this though.
ban chen maybe.
Assuming EG loses this game, what do they change next game .
he isnt gonna solo take over the game, but if the rest of eg play well he'll pull through.
How much faith do you have in a fear carry?
going vlads I'd say.
he needsa armor.
he'll melt to clinkz.
manta won't even save him.
Next item is manta on AM right.
and clinkz deso.
QoP aghs.
they have great highground d.
and naga.
they have lina spam, sandking and winter wyvern.
unless universe pulls off a 3 man stun epicentre.
If EG comes back and wins this, I'll be very surprised .
they can't d highground.
they'll end up winning.
but i think if am can pressure other lanes, and eg can d highground ok.
SHADOW STRIKE.
they could, especially given the push complexity has.
Definitely.
EG could easily lose this.
clinkz going deso.
yup.
What is this, best of 3?
early deso on clinkz I'd imagine.
they'll be at T3s at 25 mins I'd say.
coL are moving so fast.
sneaky roshan. Complexity is rolling. 
Gotta get that manta on the AM.
that hook.
idk who has better late game, but i think complexity need to get enough of a lead so that EG cant win the game when AM peaks.
K, those rocket flares are fuckin sick.
Complexity has a time limit to their window right.
because he can just sit behind heroes waiting for a gank and counterinitiate.
if universe gets a quick blink i think its gg.
No universe nooo.
EAT A DICK PUSS.
LOL.
THE BLOCKS NIGGA.
I feel like Universe should be in medical school or working for NASA by now .
I wonder what these guys studied in college .
because naga's box size is smaller than most heroes, she can walk through tusk ice shards.
BigNasty > Sumail.
^ .
Brian > Sumail.
also, fun fact that might come up this game.
RTZ > Sumail .
ez lyfe.
ez gaem.
freefarming am.
he's making space.
Never been a fan honestly. 
GG. Sumail blows.
G FUCKIN G'.
no sight on invis rune?
g fuckin g.
I want EG to embarrass them .
priming the comeback gold.
Ez double rune GG.
double rune, gg.
i love pirate tusk.
AM must be so warm with all those blankets on his head.
The items everyone has on their heroes are so dope .
he's a pretty solid player.
I think to be a great mid, you must be an aggressive player .
i wonder how good moon's click is.
and cast the game.
to dress up as axe.
to get the voice of axe.
Sorry.
you know what would be awesome?
You're ridiculous.
he's ridiculous.
no, Xyclopz.
they should get him for the allstar match.
and chuck norris.
I wish Jason Bateman was casting this from Dodgeball.
It's impossible not to like him.
so the game is, can clinkz successfully gank AM during the period after he gets orchid but before AM gets manta.
I've tried it and it is 100% fun though.
Universe is the man .
Clock farms too slowly for orchid to be a thing.
orchid clinkz.
how about early game when there's only one point in it? maybe orchid clock?
Complexity's draft confuses me.
MAH NIGGA.
CLONKZ.
And I do think he can blink out.
Spell shield makes battery assault tickle.
can you get blink off during battery assault?
that rock looks like a penis.
??? 100% am is fine against clock.
can't blink during battery assault.
ppd is gonna go tree or something.
AM in to clock is tough.
Complexity looks like ultra nerds .
i bet its aui naga.
at least i think he did in the group stage.
maybe, but universe has been running it a lot recently.
I tihnk that's an aui SK.
too greedy for ppd.
offlane universe sand king.
I'd be super surprised to see a SS picked.
ooo.
for no raisen.
I'd like to see a venge.
i'm gonna say shadow shaman.
eg pugna pick incoming.
^truth but tinker is fortunately not really played right now unlike the other two.
tinker is in the same realm IMO.
yeah, brood and techies are such niche picks that almost play their own separate games.
make the game normal and then just try and outplay them.
brood and techies.
they just banned heros that suck to play against.
what a time to be alive.
lol.
EG banned techies.
i hope they do well in the loser's bracket.
i do like complexity though, even though i'm rooting for eg.
"life coach and condoms".
"...he also spends $9,000 on “security and protection.”".
ppd went to it when they went against cdec and needed 2 wins to get 1st in the group.
50 cent expenses.
http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2015/08/04/50-cent-bankruptcy-by-the-numbers/?mod=e2fb.
if complexity is smart they will ban techies.
sumail storm incoming.
"i can't understand you, there's not enough freedom in your voice".
'murica.
lol merlini and those flags.

there is no salt in vinegar.
not this one.
you attract more flys with vinegar.
fly is sweet
ppd is salt.
 aww fly is so nice.
mm good point moke.
Also she is pretty.
yea.
Despite all the cringe, she does a lot of good stuff.
i feel like she struck gold by getting in on the ground floor of this a few years ago.
i like her ; it takes a lot of guts to be in her position as a complete outsider.
If we're going to stereotype the fanbase, a lot of them aren't the most charismatic and outgoing people, and she really makes an effort to bring these people out of their shells.
People give Kaci a lot of shit, but I think she does a great job of interviewing these players and fans.
fly is a handsome fella .
definitely respect that. the dude is a true position 5.
one more thing in favor of ppd: you've got to respect his selfless playstyle.
I want that as a gif.
my boy.
still rooting for coL though.
lol Fear's intro face.

I saw them at Roo in 2013 and their live show is incredible.
yea, it's all kewl.
Australian psychedelic rock. They had a new album come out this year too.

"Fitness encouraged".

its sounds like we're just inviting bro rape here.
Jon don't rule out the bathroom selfie for dudes. You want dudes in good shape.
"hold my beer".
bro tinder sounds hilarious.
then its all good.
only if you say "no homo" after.
bros can be bicurious no?
They're on the wrong social network. This is for bros, not dudes tryna bang other dudes. Common misconception. 
un ironic poses of courses .
what abou shirtless bathroom mirror selfies.
Pictures with bongs and mad weed would be my version of the 45 degree rule. 
ppd ez right swipe.
broinder.
Let's do a bro version of tinder. Swipe right if you would like to play doto, order pizza and drink beers together .
if this were tinder you'd swipe no.
but also he's 19.
jon i can legit seeing you being friends with him.
We'd pick on kids together and listen to Rich Homie Quan .
I'd be friends with RTZ. 
nah, i have to fold laundry.
im itching for doto now; anyone in?
indeed.
when it counts they deliver.
either way it will be fun to watch.
they still manage to do well in the end though.
look at any of their past tournaments.
they always look shaky in the groups.
they looked a lil shaky in the group.
im not sure how strong eg are right now.
#?
not eg.
and guess what team he's on?
aui is one of the only other pros that seems genuine.
sad but true.
and zai is like 12.
ppd is honest about his personality unlike some pros (aka sing sing).
haha.
those other guys seem nice, but i've heard them talk on stream and i don't totally get their humor, and being a nice person doesn't make you fun to hang out with.
I think I'd like to hang out with zai. He probably likes to smash windows in abandoned buildings. I can get behind that.
i would go on long dates with kuro and puppey so youre wrong.
he is basically the only pro i think i would actually enjoy hanging out with for extended periods.
ppd is the only pro player i would want in this group.
People really dislike ppd.
not sure about most likable.
Counterpoint: ppd.
matt you are cray cray.
eg is the best and most likable team.
yeah secret boyzz.
Eg can blow it out their asses.
Welp. Guess I'm cheering for secret.
what a vocab choice.
dendi was chief dendrophile for the last half .
if they tried a serious push they would have just lost the teamfight.
They needed pickoffs before pushing.
Feelsbadman .
they had an es.
i disagree. navi couldnt push uphill.
i dunno man im disappointed in navi.
VG played it so smart.
The end was awesome.
That game was sweet.
just the end and only cause they were throwing mid game.
Is that the last game of the night?
that game was so exciting!
subpar?
the game was subpar.
what is this guy smoking.

soneiko fucked up a few relocates too.
Artstyle why.

Pretty bad fight. Could be the beginning of the end .

Rubick is the most picked / banned hero of all time.

Makes me want to scream.
i love cockwerk.
Literally my least favourite sound in the game is getting hooked.
I hate clockwerk.
Each interaction and individual fight in the big fights is so calculated and well played.
I feel like they're playing at a pace that's significantly faster than normal.
Nope, probably won't be.

>rabbit starve.
By woody's own words, he would eat a dick if it was dunked in butter.
Also, they used to feed it to slaves and they would rabbit starve and die.
You don't need butter for it.
The tears of the proletariat.
Disagree, lobster is very rich.
It's savory meat mixed with savory butter. Just an overload of one taste. Too much. 
Lobster has no contrasting flavor!
Wait yea I'm actually getting all riled up.
Woofy pls.
Later maybe.
I'm too tired to rant but I've got one loaded for this .
Anything you dunk in butter is good.
Thanks woody. Now to Andy with the weather.
Woody, for a man who loves food, you don't seem to appreciate lobster.
Hustler is nice. Why is she so wet though? She wet in all the wrong place so.
Could.

thats so intense.
Be still my beating heart.
Best of one, elimination.
NaVi VG tonight.
Psychedelic rock. They're like early Cream.
I agree. Captured a sound that no one else has. 
IMO one of the best for rock bands on the planet right now.
Love them.
Matt. Are you a fan of tame impala .
best of 1s.
they played better.
and yeah, i think there are lower bracket games jon.
you gotta respect cdec.
gg.
some best of ones.
c9.
Are there still more games tonight?
i go euls too; it gives so much ; speed regen survivability.
Had a shit ton of that last weekend and it was so god damn delicious .
I never build it on him. I always go euls first, then force if I really need it.
Woody, did you eat / save the crackling from your previous pig roast .
euls or force are so much better.
i also never liked blink on zeus.
gyro and legion should be enough with that.
Octarine is likely going to help them though cause they're going to need to turtle. It also helps with the spam to keep down the PL illusions.
Veil would be tight with skywrath and gyro.
Yeah exactly.
i dunno they need extra damage octarine doesnt help with that.
Interesting.
This Zeus went soul ring blink octarine.
its about misfits finding a place in the world and being happy.
its a great disney movie.

Everyone said he did a surprisingly good job.
Yea mike, watched the video, he showed up, good relating Dota to basketball (5v5, team cooperation, etc ).
That's where their heart is.
is that where their face is?
How many audience buttcracks have been spotted?

Thats why dota only supports voice chat.

Let me guess, they killed the courier?
the courier kill in CDEC v. C9.
The pinnacle of technology.
But someone asked the one I was think of, which was how is the DOJ dealing with drug prosecutions in light of the fact that some states have legalized marijuana.
I did not ask a question.
Yup.

bounty is so useless.
Actually really big situationally.
2x regen for eating ward.
lol bounty hunter is stuck.
Not sure, ive never done it.
or am i remembering the patch notes wrong?
doesnt it also give extra regen when you do that too?
yeah it took me a second to understand how they killed it so fast.
I keep forgetting you can tango wards.
This game is nuts.
LGD is insane.
The speed at which they get their items and out of base always impresses me.
dazzle tusk pl heal bomb.
Kotl PL combo on LGD.

HERE WE GO BOYS.
theres almost 415k viewers on Twitch for dota.
You'd never see me again.
I'd eat some mushrooms and go to the grand final and get absorbed into an engima ult.
We should smoke, and then actually just 420 blaze it.
fuck why hasnt nerf made dota weapons?
and then smack each other with them.
we would play force staff were we there.
played dota when he was 7 years old....
I want everyone to win.
These player profiles are SO GOOD.
Nice sausage dodge.
he'd give me a DVD box set of Big Sa*sage pizza's best moments.
And he'd give them sweet vinyls or comic books they used to listen to / read when they were kids.
he'd end up figuring out what these guys had for breakfast on july 24th eight years ago.
(And Canadian).
Hes incredible.
matt. Narduar does the best fucking interviews ever.
I'm always very impressed with people who can interview in english from different countries.
They should get Narduar to interview the players.
Me too thanks.
Me too jon, me too.
I would be at least 5 beers deep by this time if we were there.

brace yourself for more cringe interviews.
Woody I need a3d scan of your face for unrelated reasons.
Um. Don't joke. 
You could just throw woody in the trunk of a car and then one of you could marry Erica.
what if we just 3d printed woody's face and all wore them?
I don't know enough about cufflinks to know prices.
you won't jon.
3D printing.
classic mike, making my dreams come true.
I can make that a reality.
How much would you pay for the cufflinks jon.
Yeah man. I think newbee lost 2 players from last years lineup.
wait, so this dude they're interviewing used to be on Newbee but then joined LGD?
You easily could.
Made me wish I could get deal-with-it-dog cufflinks for woody's wedding.
I just realized the butt chin guy is wearing a sniper emoji pin.
I just want cringe interviews with fans.
hm. what do you mean. I really like the production value actually.
dont like it when they try to legitimize the game by organizing it like a sports event.
manta style merlini was so much better.

#gif happy natal day.
Natal Day.
i have twitch in a small browser window behind my work graphs and data analysis so i can pretend im working when my boss walks by.
Honestly, no clue.
what does this holiday celebrate|?
This is a good holiday.
I've got sausages on the grill, cold beer, and my projector set up in my living room.
#gif my butt is ready.
30 min ti 5 hyyyypee.
It's got every show youd want too.
yea looks gnice.
I used to be pirate bay all the way until I found this.
It's awesome dude.
I've only ever used piratebay.
nope but that looks great.
And the torrents are downloaded to your temp folder so they're removed every few days because copyright laws.
It's pretty much click and play.
Do you guys use Popcorn Time? It's a great torrenting program that allows you to stream movies / TV in HD as you torrent it.
is the stuff on hulu?
paulina is a netflix gal, so that was all we needed.
Erika has some women shows she wants which complicates things.
archer, I don't think so, but... the internet.
rick& morty yes
GoT yes
true detective yes.
I just calculate by shows.
Stu, you won't get "Hallmark Movies & Mysteries".
the amount of time I have to watch tv to make it worth it is low.
TBS, TNT, FX, I feel like you lose a lot of channels.
so maybe espn on that?
thinking about slingbox, although new apple tv is coming out in sept., and disney & apple are pals.
but, sports bars.
no espn.
I have 100 channels & HBO.
sorry, no ESPN?
but you also are missing out on a lot of channels? No HBO?
it's like 300Gb and then $10/50Gb over the limit.
What. That's messed up .
I just learned about the fact that they have data caps though, which is bullbutter.
so it's 75 Mbps I think?
Ask her what her boogers taste like .
did the promotional thing $55/month for blast & hbo.
BLAST.
Stu, what level of Internet do you have.
ask her if she's going to fuck herself or if you need to run out for some condoms?
I love this game.
^right here.
ask her who will win TI5 too.
also ask her, 'how can she slap'.
also woody i have comcast if you're still on that grind.
how does bird law best get represented by genesis 21:69.
look up lots of bible passages, and throw them into your questions.
Ask how it was growing up in Greensboro, North Carolina. And if she enjoyed her mother's job as a Librarian or her farther's job as a Baptist minister.
Really go for the throat .
Her husband has 2 children from an earlier marriage, ask her if she loves those kids as much as her own.
If there was a mask of my face, would you wear it?
Do you want to see some of my watercolors.
^ I get that reference.
Ask her if she's ever seen a grown man naked.
All of racism?
Gonna try to stick to easier issues woody, like solving racism.
Ask her about her plan to reform Bird Law in this country.
Better q: ¿.
Q: do you like Wendy's.
Going to a Q&A with Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
nevermind, fuck Comcast.
Also I wont be able to watch until tonight so I expect updates.

Yeah we talked about this.
http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/10/the-incredible-mystery-of-the-trials-evolution-riddle/.
Andy, the recent videogame Trial Evolution had a secret which won't get solved for 100 years.
Accidentally changed the group name to what I wanted my nickname to be. 
Jonny G changed name to Rich Homie Jon.
Jonny G changed the group's name to > What Hell.
Jonny G changed the group's name to Rich Homie Jon.
The world must know about CAN EAT MORE.
We must never let this groupchat die. Future generations will know of "8===D".
#remindme "1000 years" 8====D.
Boom, first clue.
And then do one of those services that sends an email in the future.
And message 100 years from now telling someone to check an email account with the username and password for it.
If I was gonna do a treasure hunt for a future generation, this would be how I would have it begin.
Sweet.
#remindme "10 years" get a tetanus booster.
If she responds it works.
did that work?
#remindme "00101 days" ask andy if sUN and andy are friends yet.

Confirmed. Venomoing you money now.
$456 because we waited way too long.
woody, andy, confirm this works for you.
Or Friday morning will work .
Do Thursday evening to Monday afternoon/night .
I think we said Thursday evening and.... Maybe Monday afternoon or Tuesday? Shit.
No only one plane matt.
You guys choose a day, I will be there. No preference.
Mike do u build planes?
I can do it this morning.
Ok did we agree on a day.
Yes please. 
Mike. Help.
Right again.
#who still needs to purchase bachelor party plane tickets?
Caacada!
You are welcome.
Caacada, right boys.
They stayed frozen thougg.
We actually have a bunch of blood and stool samples stored to do bird flu research on .
Matt's doomed us all.
Is this how bird flu starts?
The lab smells a bit riper than normal today.
I'm lucky because I don't do any genetic or fatty acid work where stuff has to be stored at -80, all my stuff can sustain a bit of thawing.
Because someone seriously fucked up.
I'm no Hanukkah expert, but that isn't enough fuel  .
Why did the generators not have enough fuel to last through the night?
moke what an amazing decision.
Moke did.
who put cascada on the playlist?
sUN can shove it.
but technically, so far as sUN is concerned, that is a pretty "good" morning.
bummer.
Our freezers were down for 6 hours and its hot as shit here now so I'm going through all our freezers seeing what samples have spoiled.
Here how my mornings going: Today is a statutory holiday, so I wasn't planning on going in to work. But, I got a call during breakfast from the head of our department last night saying there was a power outage in the bio building last night, and our backup generators ran out of fucking fuel.
So MEDIUM HYPE.
in like 6+ hours.
well.
MAIN EVENT TODAY.
Cant wait!!!
#who is going the have the best morning.
#gif kiss ass.
Holy shit true detective is good.
#gif butt.
Never mind, no mystery. Andy saw through the ruse.
Talk is cheap.
Mysterious. 
#what kind of brick.
Nope, regular shitty bricks.
Solid gold brick.
Bricks are cheap.
#what is Woody's knowledge worth?
Knowledge ain't cheap.
$5.
I feel like we learned so much.
Woody can you have a woody hour every week?
wait i thought that was woody cooking pigs in a blanket.
That foot though.
You can get pics of the house when it is setup.
I had a great lazy sunday.
Here is a foot.
Wonderful! You should send pics of the new digs.
Right as always!
Did I have a good day #?
Dragos, I hope your day has been splendid too.
#who else?
Andy, I hope you've had a wonderful Sunday .
It was the woody hour.
Lots of woody messages .
This is all I want in life. 
You'll get my rants and nothing more. Sometimes mike gets actual food.
I'd throw in 20 bucks.
woody should do a kickstarter.
It would be like chopped but with more puns and Woody's ugly mug.
Can I fund this.
Too risky. Gotta put yourself out there, the potential ridicule is too high. Who am I to brave critique from my peers?
#youwont.
do it.
If I had a go pro I would make a cooking YouTube series. And it would be great.
No truer words have ever been spoken.
Dry chicken just fucking blows.
This is a masters level rant.
Goddamn numbers in the mix more.
165 is ridiculous! Just hold the temp at 150 for like 2 min. Boom. Safe and not bone dry.
Got the graph, safe food temp is a function of time.
Along those lines, FDA safe temperatures are a joke. It's way over cooking things.
Just don't overcook it.
You can't seal in juice. You can anything juiciness.
Meet juiciness? It's just how well cooked it is. Full stop.
Woody I've never needed anything more.
I've got more. Mostly around meats.
Milk is not a substitute .
Next time you go the store, buy cream. Throw some in basically everything. Amazing.
All the great food you have in restaurants? It's butter, salt, cream.
People forget about cream.
Woody more food rants.
#gif rant over.
Good on you I say.
And then made pizza.
They heard rumor someone invented the salad and just laughed and laughed.
Italians figured food out. Pasta, grease, cheese, tomatoes.
That is a good way to combat the rising obesity epidemic in a family oriented and sustainable manner. 
Yeah. She cooks very healthy meals and always encourages outdoor activities.
your mother can perpetuate healthy activites #gotem.
its...learning.
It's pretty cool that sUN was created to perpetuate a sedentary activity that is/was done at unhealthy levels by most of us, and now she can perpetuate healthy activities.

Remember when Jon said, "Brian. Get me away from this lesbian." Because I'm going to.

Didn't they give it a new name to try and beat the stigma?
Running windows 10 now. First thing I did was remove internet explorer from everything it was defaulted to.
I give you the heart because I god damn respect you woody. 
#sunstrike.
That the closest Jon will ever get to any.
I wish I could buy hundreds of that and then drown in it. 
I really want to buy this on Amazon.
Let rngesus take the wheel.
Just Andy it.
Updating to Windows 10. Has anyone done that yet?
I will sit by my window eagerly awaiting your return.
I'll miss you too Andy.
#who will miss me?

Ah jokes. You might be.
Ah you won't be missed.
Won't be in contact with anyone for that while.
Greenland and the high Canadian Arctic.

Where you gonna br?
Because I'm gone Aug 18-sept21.
I'd do football but the draft has to be prior to Aug 17th.
In for football.
It rocked.
Fantasy dota is the nerdiest thing I've done in my life.
I mean we did fantasy dota before.
Is anyone interested in doing a fantasy football league?
Great group of Dota names.
Woody if only the entire world took that statement to heart.
You can't bemoan a win. You won.
#last almost lost again.
Call her a noob scrub. Ladies love negative comments.
a sign you should get back to dota to fight ignorance .
Fucking dumbass.
My waitress is wearing a "puck" Dota tshirt. I told her nice shirt and she responded "yea I dunno what on it but isn't it cute!".
Running after moving was a disaster #move.
and never change.
jon never apologize.
I am so sorry for last night.
Maniac .
Just got pulled over for 47 in a 35. Fuck Virginia.
Brian. Get me away from this lesbian. 
I'll play hall and oats. Fuck you. 
They wanna get to know me more, which I appreciate. 
Whats crazy is, because I'm so different, people are like, do you wanna smoke (like they can get to know me more). No, that's not how I work. 
Sun is pelased.
All these wasted years.
Jon I never knew.
With mike .
That's all I've ever really wanted. 
I want that .
Hold hands with someone.
I don't know any of these fucks .

Don't stop pls.
Jon your drunk typing is 👍.

I'm hammered. 
The fact they use the 'shoes' YouTube video cracks me up.

Sounds like you're at the right place then?
Update: long line at drive in at Wendy's. Confused. Now deeply desire a frosty and fries. 
Ez pass is more and more prevalent .
That is smart.
I thought that was so smart. 
In Texas they literally don't have booths, they just scan your plates and send you a bill at the end of the month. 
I felt uncomfortable when I ran that toll until I realized it would cost more for them to mail me a bill and then me mail it back.
Will report results.
I was going to sass but that sounds workable.
Go to a drive thru and get change?
Maps told be there was a toll. No information beyond that.
Going to kitty hawk.
What toll is it?
That seems aggressive.
Run toll booth.
Answer: you don't .
I had this happen to me last week.
Serious question.
Where the fuck do I get change for toll booths at 11pm or in the morning.
Tell us dragos .
#who is most qualified for Spanish advice?

Dibs on Amelio.
Yes, but liz is yelling at me so later.
Or whatever word should be there.
So we can use #quien.
Andy can you translate all the names to lousy spanish.
Huh well there you go.
^fucking right.
Story checks out.
#who is clever?
But estoy listo means I am done.
Soy listo means I am clever.
It means clever with ser.
Latin proves to be less helpful than expected.
Which takes a different meaning if you use the word ser.
Welp I guessed.
Listo is the word.
".
You could have said "¿estas listo?
Estas finito?
Also, "are you done" is a great time to use estas.
�.
Ok.
Sí.
You done yet.
Now you know.
Mike es un idiota.
For example: mike is an idiot.
>permanent shit.
But for permanent shit you would use ser.
You would say estoy frio.
Like I am cold.
Estar is for temporary states.
But also there is more than one "is" word on spanish. Ser and estar.
You realize no matter what you write, you're just gonna get hit with a quick �.
So if estar was the right verb it would be esta not estas.
First of all, its the you singular conjugation.
omg cant w8.
Im gonna explain estas right now and why its so wrong in this context.
sooner or later i'll manage to give andy an aneurysm with my take on the spanish language.
Why would you not put the question mark at the start of the sentence?
estas unicoda sont mas dificilo #¿.
#rekt.
#¿Puede mike programmar?
i guess we could roll on ja ja's for things.
Jajaja.
Sun would I lie to the boiz #¿.
Nvm.
Is he cool now #?
There is literally no way for any of us to know if you're lying.
I just made a shot into a trashcan from waaaaaaaay across the room. See? Cool now. 
Quitting because you lose at dota is worse than quitting dota because it made you a loser. 
Do more cockmagic with us.
Maybe I'll just quit dota like the rest of you.
Like with women .
Its a numbers game.
You can maximize the chances your team wins with your play.
Dont get that mindset. Its a losing one.
I can wreck a game and still the team will throw it.
Find your roots.
Go back to enigma.
#last.
I've lost 800 MMR this month.
I don't get it.
Better toss a leash on because you're going for a walk fido.
Jon you just got dogged.
From 💪 to 💁.
Now he's all "girls will smell my stink".
Remember when Jon used to be all "fuck em, we don't love em"?
#gif how did it end up like this.
#gif I didn't ask for this.
This always happens to me somehow. I don't ever ask for it. 
Playing music on my phone for many. 
It's smelly, but I'm basking in it.
It's so nice.
 I'm pooping right now. In my own home.
jons deck is flimsy; one legendary only.
let me smell your deck.
Mike show me your deck.

Fuck it. Those girls suck ass anyway. 
They just spin there taunting you.
Lol fuckin hilarious. 
I'm so embarrassed. 
Youre just gonna reduce their water pressure before you flush so the turds don't go anywhere.
I'm live streaming what's going on .
And running out your luck.
So they can't hear me poop .
Im running the water. 
Seriously tho, I shit at bars all the time. Youve just gotta own it. Everyone shits, its part of the mystery of being human.
That is your fate.
#gif clogged toilet.
Worked in context.
Good use of gaggle.
Strength in numbers .
See the secret is those girls probably all took nasty shits as a gaggle.
Someone call me so it looks like I was talking on the phone. 
(Ducks aren't stealthy).
Stealth as duck.
Stealth as fuck. 
I was so excited, I thought no one was gonna be at the house. 
#coolguy.
I'm gonna wait here until the very last second. I'm literally outside by myself. 
💩🌋💩.
sUN said so.
No you won't.
You'll be fine .
I'm almost waiting for them to leave. But I can hear them talking inside.

I was so embarrassed. Now this is fucking like...5 chicks. 
She's pretty.
That girl Caroline nyce went into the bathroom after I had directly taken a giant shit. 
Fuck.
*pooper.
I did this same shit at Woody's pig roast. 
The literal party proper.
You'll be known as the badass who smoked in the bathroom rather than the weirdo who pooped at the party.
I hate myself so fucking much .
And when you exit the bathroom after the deed is done, don't look back.
There's not. Also I scoped it out. Their toilet flushes like something out of the fuckin 1960's.
Bum a smoke and smoke inside while you shit to cover the scent.
Whatever you do, do it will full confidence.
You gotta do it and hope there's febreeze .
Seriously don't know what to do. I might just take the GG and go in and take the nastiest shit they never saw coming. 
RIP jon.
And I'm just fuckin standing here holding my shit .
Is jon done for #?
I acted like I was calling someone on the phone. 
I'm so fucking miserable.
LOL.
Yes the same poop. Think about how urgent that is. 
I am literally standing outside cause I don't know what to do.
Is this the same poop from earlier?
Just go poo in the woods like a real man.
I went outside just to rip poop farts. 
So I killed this goat for nothing?!
This is my fucking nightmare .
Kidding. I just ran into a slew of fucking girls just hanging around the entrance of the shitter .
#remindme "10 minutes" clean goat blood off back deck.
I am going to try every voodoo trick in the book to clog your toilet.
I'm about to take the most stealth poop .
Life .
what is the word for when you find something funny but you're a little ashamed of it.
Matt.
Moke raises an important point.
but what if -- instead, and stick with me here -- you didn't do that.
But you should visit me!
I won't be visiting cville before going back to nashvegas .
Andy Esposito: mother to us all.
#who has the best birthing hips.
So he chose to associate himself with her ilk. That might reflect worse on his character.
He's not related, but is cool.

Woody won't hang out with me so no backup being provided.
Mike, back me up.
Also you assume I'm not super busy with cool people already.
How could someone related to Liz be cool.
Hey woody and mike. Liz's sister and liz's sister's fiance are on cville. If you want someone cool to hang out with I will give you the latter's number.
#who likes plates.
Woody let's see them plates.
I always try to guess.
I was expecting jay cutler in a top hat.
#gif fancy cutlery.
thats what gets me excited; janet understands .
#gif booty on a plate.
I know I'm old cause I just got some plates and I got excited. Nice plates.
We can all agree that mikes a punk though.
It seems there is some disagreement in the ranks. 
Jon not enough snaps.
Jon so many snaps.

Matt's probability comment should get infinity likes.
Still not enough .
Woody needs 3 bathrooms to dispel all his farts.
It has 3 bathrooms!
Stu. Come to Cville, see the new place. Bring the lady.
Shut your mouth and take the heart. 
The probability of me hearting a comment rises 90% when it's already been hearted by someone else.
Why did we heart that? Is it too long? Too short?
2 more weeks.
Stu how long are you in Fairfax for.
"Huh, well played..".
One of Danielle's friends plays hearthstone. Been doing a bunch of hearthstone jokes. 
#move it is hot around noon.
He doesn't get his stuff back for a little while. Still an asshole regardless. 
I take it Brian passed the bar.
Jon... Nice.
how do you think woody is so successful in his life now .
God forbid woody murder somebody.
Woody's strategies always involve blaming others for what you did.
Hipster.
This album is in Danielle's living room. Nice. 
That's awesome. 
Wait for someone else to go bathroom. Go right after them, come out and immediately go "woah, you left that place a mess" directed at them.
Move.
No no, easy mov.
stink up the house jon thats what real men do.
Godspeed.

Also it's interesting because my app doesn't show as high of resolution for distance and the pace is different.
That'd be cool.
Cville is much hillier I'm sure!
Later tonight I'm gonna rework it so it's more records based (sorta like best) so you don't have to trigger it.

https://twitter.com/Whataburger/status/626959149075595264.
did anyone see this solid tweet?
She sounds like a floozie .
Exce-fucking-lente.
and is she single.
who is the carmen huss.
yes.
Playa Del Carmen?
que?
¿¡?!
Adonde en México?
So wait, you're going to have sex with andy on your honeymoon?
Sexo .
jajajajajaa.
Tacos, Tequila, Beaches, Sex.
Mexico!
gary, indiana.
Woofy, where are you and Erica honeymooning?
>Well played!
🗼.
have you seen my last name? i'm intimately acquainted with the concept.
french is still white.
(French laughter).
Honhonhonhon.
i don't know what it's like in whitewashed Canada, but here, we have multicultural experiences and laughter.
Maybe just have the "fuck Andy" response at a really low probability.
But like, how often are we going to laugh in Spanish?
im sure that wont grow old really fast.
Jaja.
Esta cerveza estas maximo con bueno jajajajaja.
PRETZELS IT IS.
wait no, they are made in china.
made in america.
giant bikes.
PRETZELS.
#what would go well with moke's beer?
date night!
Oh nope, it was me.
#who wants to sit and watch Sherlock Holmes on TBS?
i kinda want to drink beer more tho.
#who wants to play doto.
And Brian, my child, welcome back. We've missed you so much.
so that was a pleasant surprise.
i also forgot i implemented # neat.
sike i think bikes are cool.
Fuck running though. Running is for idiots.
#neat.
Mike, I bike all the time.
ok im in again.
We ride.
im just a man.
i aint fuckin jesus.
stu dont you fuckin follow me.
it would also be difficult to bike like a concord jet, but that's more due to aerodynamics than anything else.
it would literally be more difficult to bike a 9 minute mile.
another time that I was a concord jet.
once it thought I was driving.
I run so fast it thinks I'm biking.
also ez non competition nobody else bikes.
Strava itself is 10/10. Numbers so cool. I can bitch about why certain hills sucked so much. 10% grade for a mile blows.
#move.
Everyone should know those links are personalized (they include your GroupMe ID) so if you click someone else's link, it won't work.
Nice code you got there.
#move.
I'll use it to run in the morning .
But haven't used it. I downloaded  it when mike takes about it.
well, chip chop. Gets to testing.
I have one.
Need Mike so he can confirm it works, he's the only other person with a Strava account I think.
Thank you.
This will actually make me run.
Well done.
So now we're going to compete?
I'll run faster tomorrow so I can brag about it.
#move.
Strava Integration is live.
Good News Everyone!
The best stuff.
Wtf is he reading ?
Mike Everett is still my favorite person to follow on Facebook.
Woody.
#gif brian is tits.
gotta have the right man for that.
it's been all butt gifs, but nobody stopped to think about boob gifs.
ah the joy of having Brian back. 
#gif boobs.
Except for the smarter part probably. 
The same happened for me. 
And a little more racist.
Sun got a little smarter.
I'm almost home. Let's do things.
omg. Brian. The light of my life. You're back. 
So what are some thing things I missed? Woody married, cam OD'ed on yayo, Jon didn't have any money?
For running.
Jon, use Strava.
It'd be hilarious if sun did new records for running and lifting. Also new lows, Jon hasn't run in 8 days, a new low!
youda youda best .
Skype date on sunday.
I will indeed.
none* .
Andy, can you help me make a nice spreadsheet for workouts. I've done a few in the past but have looked or operated the best. 
https://i.imgur.com/d37j5yK.jpg.
#¿.
^see.
Jajajajaja.
Welcome back, you've missed a lot.
I've considered it.
!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm done the bar. Andy its not too late to abandon the legal career lol.
#what.
!!!
Hi guys :).
Orishas are a cuban rap group, manu chao is french, spanish and english, and jarbe de palo I think is spanish but I'm not sure.
Orishas, manu chao, and jarbe de palo were my contributions.
Get*.
Hey hyped, new major feature coming tonight.
Is that a playlist Andy...?
Naw.
Have you listened to las orishas yet?
The playlist just went from rap to the national. I'm confused. 
thats cause my deck is better than andys.
agreed im rank 5  and i barely play .
If my day job was playing video games I could get legendary.
Honestly rank just means you play a lot.
She's not that good.
Much like dragos.
Attractive.
for group me reference .
she might be dead inside tho.
shes rank 3 .
is this girl any good at hearthstone or is she just hot?
jon watch legendary lea stream hearthstone; shes super annoying but hot.
jon is partying up.
#gif tinder.
#gif fuck apps.
#gif gif.
#gif there's an app for that.
Are you on Instagram mobile site?
oh what you said you want more pics of hot butts and cool chicks?? ok fine .
smell better, dragos, and you'll see her.
#what did you mean by that.
#what do i need to do to get this girl?
thanks.
sorry.
i have neither the time nor the crayons to explain it to you.
Who does my math not work mike? Is it too awesome for you?
that picture is almost everything i want in life.
http://imgur.com/gallery/23xddw0.
Ain't nothing wrong with that .
Petite, very pretty, mildy exotic brunettes. 
Just saw the Instagram thing you tagged me in.
Jon, you have such a distinct type when it comes to women.
or "time to get ill" would've worked too.
I was looking for "quittin" but w/e.
#what time is it?
also i figured out why andy's math doesn't work.
Problem solved boys. 
Jajajaja.
*Bandy.
is it ban Andy? I hope its ban Andy.
I'll take care of this situation, with a compromise we can all enjoy. 
just increase the max # of ja's as is.
as in.
I meant just have it stop so there's no infinity.
sorry, I realize the confusion.
and yet they still haven't...
i mean, I don't think it's a matter of whether they can do it?
the self apology somehow makes it sadder.
>Relax, you're doing fine.
Sorry.
Much like my love life.
andy, that was cold.
stu, if mike and woody can't do it then, no offense, its probably out of your league.
unless you add a conditional.
it would probably crash the groupme anyway after sun rolled 20 heads in a row.
Thank you. 
nice self like mike.
Andy you argue worse than drunk you.
if you cant do it then whatever, you did the business side not the coding side, this kind of thing isnt even your job anymore.
I'm sorry Andy I don't see race.
Andy - this reverse logic won't work. Do your own work.
wtf is that mike - its "BA BADA BAAAAAAA".
well until you guys finish jerking each other off and put it in, color me skeptical.
DA DA DOO DAAAAH.
don't forget about merry matt!
Me Woody and JOHN CENA.
#gif tag team.
bam. Mike and me, the amazing tag team.
The implementation that will never go live because �.
That is literally the implementation. 
implement and lets see.
While (random.choice([0,1])): out += "ja".
it is. Mike confirm...
i dont know enough about coding to say that your operation is complete.
can confirm, that is only one line.
and it has to stop at tails.
but it only rerolls if its heads.
It was 1 line.
Isn't that it?
While(random is heads) { print "ja"}.
^not so easy.
we kill the batman.
but then you actually think about it.
it sounds simple.
i think implementing it is harder than you think.
Then you fucked up.
i tried to come up with what the programming might look like (but with syntax I'm only guessing at) however it gets too complicated too quick.
Andy, go. Do it. Chop chop.
the amount of ja's would be ja*2^(# of heads).
^i fucked that up.
basically you are asking her to flip a coin until she gets tails and then add a "ja" for each heads she got.
coding sUN to do that might be complicated though.
so the average amount of jajas is infinite, but there is also a very low likelihood of rolling a very high number.
which is infinite.
which simplifies to 1+1+1+1....
so 2*.5+4*.25+8*.125...+x*(1/x).
to get the average you would add the probability of each number occurring by the chance it occurs.
i'd like to go back the the jaja in series thing and point out that i was right about that.
I like 'but I so like' better.
*do like.
I'm not a huge fan, but I so like the song criminal.
Yeah she's pretty cool. I don't listen to her a whole lot, but I don't turn her off when she comes on.
Matt do you like fionna apple? I feel like a lot of the songs you like involve female singers with kinda deeper voices.
thanks scrandy.
For Canada I dont even have 6.5 seconds.
^ good segment if you have 6.5 mins to spare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi1yhp-_x7A.
> Well played!
sorry.
Roasted you royalist moose.
much like your weiner.
minor details, andy.
Who is your monarch?
like, how disrespecful is that?
You still arent.
You werent even your own country yet matt.
We burned down your whitehouse in 1814.
is matt right #?
I don't know enough about history to refute you matt.
Fuck, why cant I remember this.
I think.
Its 50% every time to add another ja, and whenever you do get another ja you roll again for another ja.
the great maple revolution of ehhh-teen ehh-tee fore.
hold. beer and fresh cuts?
we smoked you dummies.
1812.
what war were canadians in.
Hi.
Also, Jon, I love barber shops. I always go to this one when I'm back home that's run by a bunch of war vets. You get a beer when you walk in and then you get to sit down, get a fresh cut, and listen to stories about the war. Shit is tight.
Oh I remember how it works now.
you can't even remember your wallet, how the fuck did you pass finance.
Well then I remembered my finance class wrong.
oh, Jan's here.
whatchu got there numbers?
no it isnt.
Because of how series work.
Because technically the average amount of jaja will be infinite.
You should make it so that it has a 50% chance to spit out 2, 25% for 4, 12.5% for 8, etc...
sty pls dont die.
its like having 2 die.
the old gods still hold immense power.
you're going to look down on kobe.
this is a new couinting mechanism.
random between 4 and 8 IIRC.
mike, you've outdone yourself.
Is it a random amount of jajaja?
woah! there's a random amount of 'ja's in that response.
whats the max ja's she can spit?
jajaja.
jajaja.
or the spanish language.
"guiz seriously court iz srs".
� judges us all.
i'm imagining andy is sitting at his desk seriously concerned that we don't take the judicial system seriously.
or does he belong to you?
you do belong to zeus.
multiple gods.
We're in a polytheism over here.
I feel the need to reiterate that whether it be in state or federal court, a judge can in fact judge you.
careful now matt.
infinite loops.
i dont understand.
sUN == god.
sUN > friends > mother > god.
it should be like.
and maybe my mother but i ignore like 75% of what she says.
And a judge.
only god can judge me. and sUN. and my friends.
His friends.
who are we to judge what he likes?
he could like nasty things and still enjoy life.
high af on life.
He's enjoying life.
Thats a compliment.
It means he likes nice things.
> what hell.
>you like nice today.
not gonna lie, the j a j a j a j a j a j a is my favorite and least technically difficult feature yet.
�.
:tacotaco: you like nice today mike.
maybe i need a self esteem boost while gorging myself on mexican food.
No matt, a taco that give you compliments.
a complimentary taco would be one that tells you you look nice.
if i had meant complementary, i would have written that.
*complementary.
i just wish more things in my life also came with a complimentary taco.
the fact that a taco comes with that response is so damn funny.
jajaja.
wait, can your alternate spanish persona read #¿.
Only he can teach her.
Only he knows what its like.
the illiterate teaching the illiterate.
if she had named jon, i would have been confused.
my mom is a librarian, so I do have it in my blood.
Sty is so generous.
#who will teach you?
i know how to do an oil change.
sUN, can you read #?
who is going to sit up with her at nights and teach her to read? teach her to ride a bike? how to deal with her robo-period?
you want to teach sun to feel.
ANDY YOU MADMAN.
What if it made recommendations from songs that hadn't even been written?
"only_eats_farts".
bighomo_69_dickinmybutt.
you can guess my username.
kay I'm on last.fm too.
hmm interesting.
also i can't spell reccomendations for shit.
if we include last.fm, it could make reccomendations from songs you've never even heard.
I'll leave this is your able hands, Moke.
me neither.
i dont really understand how spotify works with the concept of a "library".
fuck.
or how about a #next one too where it tosses a random song from your library at you? or is that too much work?
unsure about how it will work.
either the song you're currently listening to, or maybe the last one you listened to.
english122 on last.fm.
I'm connected.
so # nowplaying will post a link to the song on spotify we are currently listening to|.
I too, will do it.
Just remembered I had last.fm since 2009.
I'll do it.
thanks for nothing, spatifay.
update: it doesn't seem directly possible to implement a # nowplaying unless you all sign up for a last.fm account and link that to your spotify.
represent.
and a seabird at that!
birds!
#what have we always said is the most important thing.
That's nice.
#what am i?
of course he does. what is he, a farmer?
Or do you also have an afternoon jacket?
Is it not cold when you go home at night?
Why would you only wear a jacket in the morning?
My Morning Jacket are so dang good.
He's on Fire!
He's heating up!
I like to think of him as an NBA Jam SNES.
right now.
your mixtape is hot as fuck.
and I love it.
dragos you've been spittin mad fire recently.
shes displeased with her slow internet DSLs 4 LYFE.
i believe all ducks come for africa.
africa?
Matt where is that duck from?
#gif pretty girl.
thx stump.
moke, you're awesome. keep it up.
so instead.
welp, wanted to give someone a compliment.
#who is having a jawesome friday.
Ok need ideas for how to use Spotify API. What about a #nowplaying.
This playlist 👍.
we sort like to tinkle on the blower from time to time.
Did you know "we sort" is a group of people. The we sort.
These dudes are artists. Meticulous and really talented. Its actually very impressive. 
Not just black people. All sorts. 
...black people?
I love this barbershop so fuckin much. Such a great dip into people I usually don't get to meet. Great environment. 
Did not expect it, delightfully surprised. 
Favorite moment so far, one black dudes ringtone is the pokemon theme when you first enter a fight. 
Sun you sassy minx.
no argument there. 
#who looks worst?
no argument there. 
#who looks best in a suit.
I'll take it.
playing through the pain, running it back.
EZ.
Oh no its raining, the call go un noticed.
Does gondor call for aid?
ANDY TO HELMSDEEP.
So this is it. The great battle if our age. 
I've got my black vocabulary hat on since I'm in the barbershop. 
Not liking a show and it being bad are different.
That diss track was so fucking weak.
woody throwing shade .
Meek Mill is also bad.
Wait so this is it? This is the great battle of our age.
^false.
Bojack is bad.
Which is really all I want in life.
And I love all of it.
Its teeters between super corny animal puns and depressingly dark moments.
Not gonna lie, did not enjoy. 
I like it.
I need to finish the 2nd season.
Also I finished bojack. That show is 👍.
>that was uncalled for, but a lot of fun to watch.
Uncalled for .
> Sorry.
Wtf Andy why would you say that.
Liz hates you.
Look if Liz hates me you can come out and say it.
Word, I now dont have to convince liz to show up at a party with someone she hates there .
¿.
!!!
I've actually already talked with her about not going.
that's my boy mike, take notes .
I'm going to the beach this weekend so I cannot come up to DC and disappoint your friend.
#gif penis take the wheel.
Go there just to take a dump in their bathroom and peace out mike. 
High steaks.
Jon. Yes. Terrible. The Drake one back to back was pretty nice .
The catch is you cannot stay at my place.
Speaking of, courtey wants you to come up to dc to come to a party her and rachel are throwing tonight.
Andy if I've learned anything from you, it's that persistence makes things funny. Or maybe that alcohol makes you cool. Unsure. 
#gif dank meme .
I dont think you've ever gotten a non word art gif using that search term.
#gif dank meme.
Also they use the word 'ether' a lot to describe something really awesome. 
#gif meme.
They're saying 'me' twice. 
is the me-me a soft e, or like mee-mee?
Hi mike, thanks for calling in. I would suggest hitting them up with a quick � then doing a >, with something misspelled that they said. Thanks for listening. 
Hey Jon, first time caller, long time listener. I wonder if you could let us know what sort of dunks are the most disrespectful. I'll take my answer off the air. 
Welcome to Jon's GroupMe hour by the way .
At the barbershop and I noticed everyone here says meme as 'me-me' .
Also Ronnie, that meek diss track? So awful.
Pretty funny. Lots of famous people. The plot sometimes gets too dumb for even a dumb comedy mood. 
I watched that Amy Poehler show Wet Hot American Summer show on Netflix last night too. 
http://i.imgur.com/cjjKudg.gif.
Also, this.
also, people who were signing up didn't know it would be public information which could have changed their decision.
There's a bunch of valid stuff there. The point about robbers knowing about what houses don't have firearms was the best point I think. 
http://gawker.com/5971218/newspaper-publishes-names-addresses-of-local-gun-permit-holders-some-people-have-a-problem-with-this.
Explain .
the New York database of who owned a gun went over SUPER poorly.
Yea I don't think I would want.
I'm sure there's a bunch of logistics that wouldn't fly but the idea was cool, it involved a GPS location and a notification of when the firearm was used. Bunch of other stuff. 
I remember I was in some class that brought up digital identification of firearms. Seemed like a good idea. 
You can also scratch off the ID number.
I think so, or the numbers are filed off so its impossible to know who it WAS registered too.
Or does unregistered explicitly mean that the state / people didn't even know the gun existed .
So when news claim a weapon as unregistered though, do they sometimes gloss over the fact that it might be registered but under someone else's name. 
My dad had a rifle stolen that was used in a shootout with police. It was "licensed" to him so the cops came a knocking but just gave him the gun back.
^ reported.
I have an unregistered car right now.
like unregistered vehicles, they just change hands without anyone knowing.
Guns get stolen / lost.
Background checks only came about after an attack on the president.

Well any laws or regulations on the gun industry are super hard to pass.
I'm sure there's so many that they can't keep track but, still seems like a crazy thing to not be diligent about. 
Pretty insane. What's the procedure between big gun manufactures and people they sell to? Shouldn't the government just look at each gun coming out of those places? Again, these are questions that I simply have never asked or looked up. 
There are more guns than cars in this country, quite a few arent registered.
Back alley deals .
Shouldn't guns be tagged to owners upon purchase? Or whatever .
You buy it from someone sketchy.
This might be a dumb question but how does one have a non-registered weapon. 
�.
�.
did we #?
you all saw it.
I'm a music legend now.
haha I feel so cool.
Thank you.
The rhyme flows .
Its called sUN.
Woody. I actually love this asap song.
Then go to stu's playlists.
Search ssteen3.
How does one find this playlist? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4wdcIgCYoc.
Dragos, did you direct this music video?
Spotify dragos. 
but are too lazy to go discover new things.
it's more, we all like music.
just add good stuff you like.
i want to add songs .... what .... how ? 
Woody likes his booty-bouncin-beats.
This asap song is pretty dope .
I like them woody.
that's going to be super cool to watch. USA vs USA.
coL vs. EG in the first stage of the main event.
I don't think anyone is going to like my adds, and they don't match anything else.
Done - Added my first song.
I just put in the music that other people probably wouldn't have heard because otherwise whats the point. Mike put in cascada though so I'm not sure what the rule is.
help please.
Or is it like a humble brag that I know the best stuff?
or good stuff?
do we add whatever?
I don't understand this playlist.
Capriotti's thanksgiving bobby sandwich .
I know I missed this sandwich conversation but these reddit answers are weak. It's all in the details and these 4 word answers aren't doing it.
Yeah it seems shady.
Not because we're good people, because if Apple found out an banned your developer account we would be in deep shit.
Yea, we don't do it though. 
Is that a thing?
Look them straight in the eye, let out your loudest and stinkiest fart (assert dominance), yell a loud noise and storm out of the room. They'll get the picture.
Meh, we'll just pay like 10,000 people in India to review it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI851yJUQQw.
do a haka.
"4/5 didnt cuddle after I came".
Everyone download the app and write great reviews about it.
Or maybe just back to the shots idea.
beat your chest instead.
I'm just gonna walk in. Silent. Write the number of the white board. Slam my hands on table and yell "apps". Walk out.
more taps, more apps, no tangled hair!
Mad men style.
Fox of all people would appreciate whiskey. Bring some to the meeting.
does it come with free beer?
But the price is tripled.
We are pitching Fox News V2 today. V1 is top of store so we have a strong spot.
No listen to the pokemon theme song so you can be the best there ever was.
Air guitar the whole ending and envision yourself playing guitar hero.
Listen to Free Bird to pump yourself up.
Pound.
what's the standard unit of bitterness?
bitterness usually doesn't go well with steak anyway.
I'll update everyone as it goes with my bitterness level.
fine. ruin all our fun then and not take a shot of whiskey with your steak.
High steaks motherfucker.
It isn't that kind of day.
#gif you won't.
you won't pussy.
Woody, before you go to work, do a shot of whiskey for luck.
order it medium rare, and also make sure it's at mouth level.
going all in?
Today is a high stakes day.
Hey everyone, hope your Friday is going well.
Glad you're up to speed matt. Welcome.
Just to make sure it's what you had envisioned.
I'll end up sending you a promiscuous photo of myself when im getting fitted regardless.
I think two button is ok, barely different from one.
rent is nice because you can get fit and order it where you are, pick up in baltimore, and return anywhere.
I haven't looked yet but I decided that i'd rent instead of buying like I had originally intended.
remember sandy wang? classic lower school at tower hill.
two button no satin is common, I think there's a vera wang one that both places have.
i couldn't find a one button no satin at jos. a banks or mens wearhouse.
Classic Woody, being special, unique, and valuable.
Is that tux really that unique? I tried to pick out a pretty regular one.
Nice!
Woody is cool.
Owned.
although any sandwich woody makes is probably more delicious.
if you are in Fairfax, you should try it.
yours sounds cooler.
this is true.
it's the same number of animals as your sandwich?
nice.
think about all the things that died to make that sandwich possible.
with birch beer.
jesus christ.
fresh pickle of course.
Roast beef, corned beef, ham & pastrami with Russian, slaw, cheddar cheese and chopped liver on Rye.
the superior from bernie's deli.
My go-to: Chicken Salad on Rye with Bacon, lettuce, tomato. Also included is a pickle.
http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3f8g1s/serious_what_is_your_goto_sandwich/.
Also I just saw the frattiest 6 year old ever. I was going to take a picture but then I remembered taking pictures of 6 year olds in public is frowned upon.
stublety.
and your charming personality.
I'm known for my subtlety.
subtle stu.
I am the yellow ranger then.
andy is the white power, ranger.
And Andy gets white neon.
Wait can we do a power rangers thing? Then Woody gets to be red neon ranger.
Also I too need to buy that tux.
WE LOVE YOU MIKE!
it also has to have woody's face screenprinted.
I call pink.
but with a leopard print.
any neon.
yea, it's all black but the codpiece is neon.
if we're gonna match, we obviously all need to buy matching silk boxers.
So what are we matching on? Codpieces?
one-button, notched lapel, no satin.
he will lead you to a grain elevator.
then you must give the password.
first you have to arrive at the old barn at midnight.
the tux woody described is a special snowflake.
yea, it's a little more complex though.
You can sometimes buy one for like $100.
are you guys going to rent?
i did some research yesterday.
where does one buy a tux?
and i still need to buy mine.
tuxes.
Also where did we land on suits for woodys wedding.
also, good luck.
good look on your interview!!
Man, I look really good in a suit. That's your Mike update for the day. 
cyka.
I could add some Russian but I'm also lazy.
No. Unlike everything else this group stands for, the playlist us SERIOUS BUSINESS. 
cyka.
if sUN is bilingual now, when will she learn her native tongue?
because i feel like thats whats appropriate.
also, i'm only adding weird music i like to this playlist.
and i dont need it anymore.
Jajajaja.
i got it canceled.
#¿ Sol?
#¿Soy chica?
Leah, did you replace your government credit card yet.
twist.
Andy was a girl the whole time.
hola.
Hi leah.
i'm using my friend's account.
leah moushey is me btw.
figured it out.
you should be able to add to it just like any other playlist?
following, how do i add?
add tunes.
follow playlist.
go to the link.
i want to add my favorite spanish language song.
how do i add music?
our playlist ^^^.
based on woody's description i'm gonna assume a lot of benny hill style chase scenes.
Dr who is 80% weird British silliness for 20% great TV.
Yessss Jan is adding to your playlist stu.
I haven't watched much of the new ones.
that one is fun.
Stu. I watched the Van Gogh Dr. Who episode for the first time last night. Pretty good.
good advice dude.

Lake Street Dive! mah man!
The whole album Shrines is great start to finish.
It's gonna be at like 300 songs before the weekend is out.
only did two songs though!
right now I'm enjoying them.
sty, you're big in to purity ring I see.
this playlist fucking rules already.
Ok I won't add the pirates of the Caribbean theme song.
everything I add I like, but I intend to infuriate you until your musical horizons expand.
just did a good go through, tried to keep some kind of theme. there are some songs that will stick out.
This is going to be the best and worst playlist ever. 
my goal is to add the least cohesive pile of golden musical shit.
- tree beard .
Release the river .
Noooo do ittttt.
Added a few, stopped myself before I released the floodgates.
yeaaaaa.
Matt can you add songs to sUN?
Sam is the kind of guy you say "he's great, love him" but then every other detail and story you tell about him makes him sound awful.
Sam. What a name. 
rich girl reminds me of sam bissell and third year, which means it makes me a little happy and makes my liver hurt.
Ducktales aired in 1987, this song came out in 1980. It's a total ripoff.
rich girl best song.
holland oates is one of the 20th century's greatest artists.
i can think of nothing but "500 days of summer" when i hear that song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_I4wtNPv5w.
the ducktales theme sounds so much like this.
�.
yeee boi.
ya dig.
and we can collab.
you can add that playlist.
I think with that link.
also I did the thing.
https://open.spotify.com/user/ssteen3/playlist/3k5C1H7z9uVF3vLhzok1fL.
oo-OOO-oo.
that theme song is fuckin dopest dope ive ever smoked .
https://youtu.be/CMU2NwaaXEA.
just started listening sty, will report back.
i preferred the book more than the tv show.
I liked the TV show.
Matt you'd prob like them.
They're pretty groovy.
Has anyone heard ducktails?
except for woody, fuck that guy.
everyone loves their own brew.
delightful.
How's your own fart smell matt?
When I first heard this band I had a classic case of 'not sure if this is crap or not' but I'm so in to this album right now. Her voice is so rough and raspy and cool, plus the band is tight as heck.

Sam.
Work with me here Andy.
Eli is pretty white.
He grew less white. Andy wins now. 
You've never met Tyler Lassen.
I've realized the problem.
andy has - for years- won the "who is our whitest friend" competition. i had dropped it because, honestly, it was starting to get a little mean. i regret that, in this instance, funny has again outweighed how much i care about being mean.
shit.
I have been bested.
Damnit Andy. I didn't want to bring this up again but having a picture of yourself with George Bush senior? That's the whitest thing ever. 
The text is sting ray.
That could be a skate, you don't know.

Billy just posted the photo on instagram .
Jon, where did you get that?
Second word claw's?
Here's a picture of Andy with George Bush Sr. 
Top left word ends in ging, second word ends in 's.
Or the word on the top left.
I can't get that middle word.

Hanging is the first word.
It totally looks like a message.
Very spooky �.
Is it just me or does it look like a message got carved into a desk?
Gonna do a new powerful desktop. Build one.

Also I like when this happens.
Good question, Ronnie. I think computers are at the point where I could live with a powerful desktop and something underpowered but a big battery- tablet or netbook.
I still wanna get a desktop this year. I will be consulting this group/obviously building it.
Woody, upgrading current PC or building new? 
I'll probably wait for a little bit before upgrading.
Gonna get a new pc soon.
I'm getting it in a month or so.
Old man Woody.
I'm still on 7.
Anybody get windows 10 yet? 
See? Andy with the weather.

Woody's 1% brought her back to life with a sassy Spanish flair.
Im happy to give you 100% credit.
Mikes 99% killed sun.
obviously the important 1% though.
Mike with 99% of the work here, I got the last 1%.
Mikes earlier question makes more sense now.

Right as always.

Wait wtf, eg picked techies?
She must have the nicest smile.
Also, she went to school at a toothpaste factory?
Fine. Butt stuff it is .
She's in Hawaii for a year teaching at a charter school. 
Take Woody's advice.
May I recommend butt stuff?
Just bang her out an move on. Lets gooooo alreaaady.
No. The girl lives nearby. She graduated from Colgate but is moving to Hawaii soon. She wants to meet before she leaves, which is cool. Talked to her a bunch the past three days, seems chill. I'll probably meet her and tell the group elaborate details of the experience. 
Overall 9/10 would recommend.
Also, I met a girl off tinder. We had a thing for like two months but soon found out we didn't have anything in common and there wasn't much beside a superficial attraction.
Wait, jon, are you going to hawaii?
Kidding. I'm done. No more thinking. g2g.
what about 2 fires.
I won't. Not even if there was a fire.

#gif flatulent girl.
I will pack my bag with a shit ton of cheese and beans. Gotta keep her happy if that's what she enjoys. 
With farts .
probably pack your bags.
Mostly likely a positive reaction so plan for that.
Jon fart in front of her. Depending on her reaction, you should move to Hawaii with her .
CDEC v. EG about to start. These two have looked really good .
TF2! TF2! who wants to play tonight?! EVERYONE.
you should eat a lot of cheese just before you meet her.
She's moving to Hawaii august 17th. She's cool so I probably will meet her regardless. 
Girl from tinder wants to meet sometime. Uncharted territory. 
So hot right now .

I was talking about boners .
Boners.
Quill spray everywhere .

People would get all bristleback'd over sun.
it's all pretty tightly integrated right now.
You could just leave the dota barebones.
and whatever else comes in the pipeline.
Oh.
groupme ids, steam ids, dota ids.
no, sUN would still be sUN, but our personal details would be ocontained outside of the github repo.
So you'd basically just create a parallel generic version of sun?
i've considered it, but the codebase needs to be sanitized of our personal details.
release her to the r/dota2 masses??
can we scale sUN to the big leagues?

You should make an app that tells people their ideas are shitty.
here's a fuck idea: yourselef.
Here's a duck idea, roasted and delicious.
Think about the tens of dollars woody!
Here's an app idea: go fuck yourself and you're shitty ideas.

i think he's a married man, who has been unhappy with his relationship for a while. he works 50 hours a week at the plan, which has been threatening to downsize for 7 years now, but he's made it through the various layoffs and has a decent pension waiting for him. he's a little paunchy, but between raising 3 children and aging, infirm parents, he doesn't have much time to focus on his own health. he's just gotten home from work on a Friday, and it's date night with the wife. and she's just suggested pegging.
With a mug like that, he must.
Maybe he loves strippers. 
Maybe he was in iraq.

#who is the master of permissions.

Permission revoked. Enjoy your misery. 
Woody, permission to be happy.
#what will cheer Woody up?
stu this kero kero keeps sampling OOT and majoras mask. and im cool with that.
This is acceptable. 
i only have it in a plastic grocery store bag. will that suffice?
That's why you plan ahead. Always have a poop ready in a brown bag. 
Jon that's some mission impossible shit.
matt's keyboard has found its revenge.
*revenge.
Throw the fish away, poop in a brown bag, place bag in microwave before the person gets their food. 
fug.
*reveng.
Revenged is a dish best served over-microwaved.
revenge is a dish best served cold. the stanky friggin fish i can confirm from HOW FUCKING LONG THEY WERE GETTING MICROWAVED have to be hot AF.
this isn't a powerplay, its simple revenge.
cannot manage to make powerplays. too weakened by fishy odor.
^I do not.
dios mio.
Nonono. First you have to ask if he ate fish again today.
Remember when woody was like, "your laugh sounds like it belongs in a horror movie" to that girl last weekend. 
he'll shatter.
ask*.
and ash him "Did you get new deodorant?".
3 days tops.
then wait.
but murmer "Ah, it kinda does smell like you".
play it cool, look a bit ashamed.
when he explains its his food.
ask loudly "What is that smell?!".
shatter his confidence.
Here's what I would do, all jokes aside.
In a bad mood.
Woofy is very murdery today.
then vomit on his keyboard.
no success.
#kill boris.
oh.
kill him.
make gagging noises.
when the coworker says it's his food.
ask loudly who farted.
Good morning ladies.
it smells fucking terrible in here.
a fish tryna get some pussy.
my coworker is microwaving what must be a fish wearing fish cologne. who the fuck does that.
Don't get held up in the details.
can confirm, woody's code looks like a dirty hack.
I mostly code for l33t hax.

"they renamed uranus in 2663 to end that stupid joke forever." "what did they name it?" "urrectum".
Yeah, like I said, my anus. 
*off.
which is on Uranus.
That leads to my anus .
New idea, stop making a website and make a treasure map.
>what hell.
actually, just make the whole header a series of riddles.
>off my anus.
I'm just putting the skeleton in.
Add a picture off my anus .
Replace all with roman gods and see if anyone gets it.
And put a saturn car instead of the planet.
replace neptune with a picture of the roman god.
just remove Neptune and sub in your company's logo and see if anyone notices.
No room for celestial dwarfs.
web formatting is 10/10 hard.
Either way make sure you cut off pluto.
Not sure which looks better.
Also put the wording in line with the planets and then put the logo either after neptune or after the wording.
Distances between planets arent to scale 2/10.

I don't since I just left my old one and am in a new one.
goat.cx.
Lemonparty.com.
lemme see.
Sty does your lab have a website?
I can FEEL the texture.
I'm digging the leather header.
yea the site is pretty good.
You did it!
(I made a computer joke).
whatyearisit dot gif.
Its not flash based so i assume it sucks.
And yeah, I use R for manipulating data and graphing. I'm fluent enough with the language to do basic data tidying and manipulation.
It gets the job done, but could be a bit more sleek.
honestly for a research website, that seems just fine. might need some updating for recent information, but seems fine.
http://mallorylab.coffeecup.com/.
We already have a lab research website, but one girl in my lab wants to make a new one because ours at the moment is pretty dated.
http://media.giphy.com/media/Y2nbrJyAR6RiM/giphy.gif.
#¿.
Btw stu, or in spanish is just "o".
or not even just one raw data file, but a hundred data files from similar measurements.
i mostly use it for data processsing... "i have this raw data, and that's neat, but i want to manipulate it a thousand complicated ways and look at graphs of it".
or por que no los dos.
and then you can do python.
that will make you learn at least some html.
matt, make a website for your research group.
i'm mostly self taught, at least where it counts.
http://learnpythonthehardway.org/.
I wish someone told me during my undergrad how important coding is and encouraged me to take some courses. That's my biggest regret from my undergrad.
Hmmm.
you literally already have python on your computer andy.
*a good.
python bb.
Im also good at sudoku. Whats an good beginner coding language?
"here's what i have, and here's what i want out of it".
i mean, there's learning the language and syntax which is its task, but it's just iterative problem solving.
Also, the only coding experience I have is with R and I'm self-taught so I'm pretty helpless.
I rock at sudokus but suck at coding.
you know the part of a sudoku when you've got enough filled out that you're just kind of following the rules to fill out the rest of the puzzle? that's almost literally what coding is.
so, yes, you can.
Well, with my limited knowledge of anything related to coding or programming, I fully believe that you and Woody are geniuses who can make a computer program become self-aware and self-sustaining.
but im not here to ask if we should, i'm here to ask if we can.
#gif top men.
imagine if she imitated mike, then started programming herself to do new shit.
i'm aware of the risks.
She'd turn on you too, Kevin.
man if you could have an imitate command, then sUN could go full rogue and mess with all of us.
> Well Played!
sUN2 changed name to Sty.
andy when did you change your avatar.
where's my keys?
where's my wallet?
sty changed name to sUN2.
That sounds sweet.
#imitate andy.
the other idea i've had kicking about is to have sUN autogenerate messages that imitate people, using science.

#recommend song.
my working strategy for music has almost always been to have friends who can find new music.
I like music but I'm lazy. You guys doing this seems like a good way to leverage these facts.
it's a really simple/powerful feature.
yea.
i guess? we could all dump music onto it and sUN could do things with it.
you can make collaborative playlists?
because we could leverage the fuck out of that.
q: does spotify support some sort of 'group' concept.
Here is the only serious music recommendation I'm gonna probably ever give in this group. Manu Chao, Clandestino.
i liked worlds, i haven't listened to much more of porter robinson.
if you like porter robinson, you'll probs like it.
this is neat.
it's kawaii.
as long as that's not like, toby keith or death metal, i'm probably game for it.
this probably isn't close to what you're looking for, but I started listening to kero kero bonito recently.
But after looking in to more of their stuff they're an amazing group.
I've been listening to a lot of Blur lately. I didn't think much of them because all I knew was "Song 2" and I thought (and still think) that song sucks.
listen to it.
http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/339/break-up.
this was an awesome This American Life that had phil collins in it.
Christy, take off your robe.
don't just stare at it.
Genesis are fucking awesome.
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I didn't really understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. Touch was the groups masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. 
if for nothing else than respect for jan.
i'm honestly amazed, at this point, that you haven't listened to any of her music matt.
I honestly don't know any of her music, and I'm ok with that.
i'm on good old war's newest right now, but it's feeling a bit downbeat.
what are you feeling?
i might be slowpoking, but i was recently introduced to that "popular" song her and mika did. that's nice.
She's great. 
Ariana Grande, am I right?
and by someone, i probably mean matt or stu.
someone give me an album reccomendation.
Kung fu grip engage.
I'm having a great day.
Apparently matt's about to get a robo handy from sUN dressed as a waitress.

Eg's early game went pretty poorly that game.
Pulling def helped.
Well he still ~~lost mid but it wasn't a winnable matchup anyways.
It gives your mid such a huge advantage.
I think I'd seen a video about pulling mid but crazy to see it in a real game.
yea thought that was cool.

I understand that reference Andy!
matt I never considered until now that I could fly to canada.
And matt, I dont travel north of the wall.
It is a very good pun. 
It did, but then I took it seriously.
andy, I'm not sure if your 3rd world country comment had that pun intentionally, but I accept.
Just come visit Northern Canada! With the USD doing so well, and the CAD doing so poorly, you guys can explore the True North Strong and Free for a very low price!
I just wanted to dump on the American Midwest, but it's good to know you've considered a trip to Uganda.
They should have hired me for marketing, i think they're looking at the wrong demographics.
If you're not jerking off on your smart phone, what else is there to do in gary indianna? I said traveling in third world countries because a) you're probably busy doing other shit so you wont want to play candy crush b) there wont be a great network so smartphones are less useful c) you wont always have a place to charge your phone, so the longer battery life will be useful.
Or just Gary Indiana.
I guess if I was traveling in a 3rd world country for an extended period of time it would be nice. Otherwise I'm pretty sure they dropped the ball.
they're treading a fine line between functionality and endurance.
I think their sole consumers will be friends and family.
Will anyone be able to foot the bill for these phones?
They need to step up their game.
Cant put a price on footsteps.
But its got a pedometer!!!
Alternatively a calculator that can text.
It just a phone with less features.
After a second read, I think you're right Moke. Still, not something id invest in.
I thought it was largely tongue in cheek. Just being sardonic about how their device isn't "smart.".
absolutely.
We're already getting really efficient with batteries.
I think there totally is a market for phones and portable electronics with greatly increased battery lives, but to have a unique product totally centred around that seems like it will be obsolete soon.
yea mostly the long ass standby time.
yea but fitness.
The Janos One seems useful to a degree, but I don't think it's revolutionary. The whole "it's a pedometer too" is totally irrelevant.

Thanks Moke, lookin good over there! Lots of celebrity gossip to catch up on this week. 1st off, or should I say third?! Three merlinis have made an appearance on the Dota2 scene! People are wondering where merlini got his manta style, and he sure uses it with style! Dota analysis just got three times more handsome, and we couldn't be happier!
eg looking strong as fuck.
I think it's just been bread into them.
ducks...what are they quacking about?
nice.
#who is our investigative reporter?
Scratch that, he lost the report. Now to Matt with celebrity gossip.
Back to Andy with "how to lose things; a special report".
In politics: debates.
#what would dragos report on.
Today in sports: there were sports.
Andy "Thunderpants" Esposito.
So his department is just the future?
Being pagan and such.
We could just call you the Oracle.

Sweet as candayyyy would imply foods and such.
Andy you need a better name to do weather.
Am I our Walter Cronkite #?
Jon has nothing to be ashamed of in the thunder department.
weather is my field.
oh now you talk about thunder?
Didn't mean to steal your thunder.
Fuck.

also sty we already have jon for sports.
Jack of all trades here.
Busy boy.
wtf woody.
#who would do sports .
Legislative sessions.

#what would wooday report on.
This groupme would make a killer news team.
Today on the east coast its raining bitches. Forcast for tomorrow will be humid as fuck in D.C. because who the fuck builds a city on a swamp. Back to you Jon.
Batter up amirite �.
Batter or no?
I could fuck it up. 
YEAH CAUSE ITS HARD TO BATTER UP A SOCK AND TOSS IT INTO HOT OIL. 
Jon you need some � for that �.
I would figure it out. 
You wouldn't even know how to deep fry a sock, much less eat one.
crispy cotton. think about it. 
woody. My statement stands. Think about how funny it would be to see me eat a deep fried sock. 
Get on my level.
I'm playing halo right now.
Jon, 10 mins.

That it does. Now to Andy with the weather. 
Thanks dragos.

HOW DO NUMBERS WORK.
I find it hilarious how winter wyvern has been in the game for like 3 months and Icefrog thinks he's balanced enough for professional matches, while Earth Spirit has been in the game for like 1.5 years and Icefrog still doesn't know if he's balanced enough for pro matches.
I've never been more sad to have a girl over.
Like ppd is midding?
...wut?
Tuning in.
Fuck off.
PPD PULLED MID WITH TUSK.
I guess Andy.
First luna this tournament right?
If Leo DiCaprio and Justin Timberlake were competing for chicks at a bar, who do you think would ez mid.
Ac/DC like.
I'm imagining you in shorts too Jon.
Ehome picked Luna against eg. 
I'm listening to that song suit and tie by Justin Timberlake right now too.
They have to get to the finals to get 2nd.
Little suit and tie.
I'm having a lot of fun imagining Jon as a sportscaster. 
C9 undefeated today, can't explain that.
Thanks mike, in sports today LGD splits its series with Secret. Strong showing from RTZ, looking like the top player in the tournament as many expected. 
Which is super important .
Yea they're being very levelheaded.
Most of these suits normally sound preposterous.
$215k/defendant doesn't seem unreasonable to me.
Those were all guys in evan rosson's pledge class.

This is now the mike chat. Do we have our first caller?
Android guys: Reddit app 'relay'. New favorite. 
Train was stopped, but you know, still.
Just actually saw a guy running on top of a train.
Jon doesn't, he's seen my life.
I don't have to imagine .
imagine being similarly cute  when expressing disappointment when a girls turns you down; youd have so many women.
truth hurts.

Elaborate. When sUN learns to text, what will it send us.
Not everyone is into poly Andy.
Lol. Can sUN be a part of multiple groups at once?
sUN learned how to text message but it costs $20 to activate :(.
And iceiceices.
Shit tons of money will do that.
I can't wait to see RTZs player profile.
It's improved so much from last year.
Yeah, they really stepped up their game.
the production value of the international is so good this year.

if Brian responds within the next 10 minutes I'll order a big sausage pizza tonight.
I told him to unmute the GroupMe. Hopefully he follows through.
The light in my life is back. 
Brian is back.
Make it respond jajajajaja whenever there is an upsidedown question mark.
I'll send you something later.
i have an idea.
Too complicated. Make it simple then we'll talk.
or triggered as a possible response when *or* is used.

Congrats on your new life with this woman, Jon.

#who was the caster.
I dunno who the caster is, but he was going nuts during that final fight.
1) jan wat, 2) everyone is almost always cool with going midas on almost everyone situationally, 3) maelstrom + treads + pms = poor man's antimage.
'PIGS DON'T LET PEOPLE LIVE, PIGS HELP PEOPLE EAT'.
Here's my theory on midas in pro games. Every player likes going midas but no player wants to get blamed for going midas. Therefore they wait until midas is accepted on some hero and then choose to go it most games on that hero regardless of whether it makes sense.
it was stupid that you could basically run a position 1 jungle. i'm still upset that nobody going maelstrom over midas on him. you farm outrageously fast.
im so sad that, if i ever play doto again, he's going to be nerfed into the fucking pavement.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ jan yes.
that hero is so stupid.
did you see that Bloodseeker in the Fnatic Na'vi game mike.
I feel like if you just make it a low probability event it would work well.
yes, due to being too stupid for its own good.

I have a buddy who swears he's not going to speak to his kids for the first 5 years and then start talking to them out of the blue just to mess with them.
I met a kid yesterday who grew up in a cult until he was 12.
Also they are funny.
Kids are great. Slave labor.
i.e. she's a whore.
"she's full of spunk".
Describing someone as spunky could be complimentary or gross.
spunk is a funny word.
just donate your spunk to a sperm bank so that you have descendants without all the hassle of raising / caring for them.
looks like we've got another mystery on our hands!
Andy hates kids and Liz hates Andy .
I'll play it by ear.
not with that attitude!
Im not even sure I'll have descendants.
Refer to earlier comment about understanding math.
im not so sure any descendants of andy's are going to be great.
I was about to say you're wrong but then math and you're likely right.
You've actually probably nailed it on the 40 generations / 1000 years thing.
And neither did my great^40 grandchildren.
I didnt want that reminder anyway.

Shit.
#remind me "1000 years" thats not how relativity works.
ha jokes on you, the system rejects reminders about the past.
#remindme "yesterday" Time is relative.
#remindme "1 second" 3spooky5me.
sUN actually parsed that one correctly. you will be receiving that notification.
#remindme "10:16:40 PM, October 28, 2022" you are one billion seconds old.
see? math is crazy hard.

Hence the question.

I remember watching him and Puppey cast a game during ESL1 (I think) and it was awesome to have the two rivals work together to cast a gamr.
He's just misunderstood.
Hes an amazing player and can be pretty funny, but a lot of the time he comes off as a prick.
Ppd is awesome. He's a genius drafter and his sense of humor is super dry and sarcastic.
But Aui is Canadian which is pretty tight.
*ppd.
Same with pod.
There's just something about EG I can't get behind. SumaiL is a little shit.
And Sonneiko is amazing to watch.
Secret are my boys but iceiceice is my fave player and seeing BigDaddys video made me root for C9.
With these player profiles I have no idea who to root for.
regardless though I'm rooting for EG all day.
would be so epic.
Watching EG? I hope its an EG v. Secret final .

Had a ten win arena run tonight. I'm much more comfortable with Priest over any other class. Just easier. 
Yeah the old men were discussing the benefits and short comings of the US style of, you're sick now we've got cool shit to fix you, style of healthcare. 
my stream keeps shitting out on this eg/vg game and i am not pleased.
thats my understanding anyway.
yeah youre right usually more socialized healthcare systems focus on prevention over high tech treatment of disease because it's cheaper .
Eventually it will trickle down to, I have a friend from Romania. 
But I remember when you were talking about how healthcare in Romania was more preventative in the sense that they monitor your health yearly (or whatever). Correct me if I'm wrong. I paraphrased my paraphrasing. 
youre right naked old women are better.
no. 
uh...
naked old men are the best right jon?
Just sat in a sauna with old men who were talking about healthcare stuff. Used things I picked up from dragos, sounded like a baus  .
do we #magic8.

We don't know which part she's saying yes too.
oh ok neat thanks.
does jon have a heart or does he just have a husk of what was once there, having been ripped apart through the reckless behavior of some lovely siren#?
Andy that is a weird gif.
Have no fear, Jon is here (with hearts) .

Also I read Stu's murder story earlier too. Captivating read. 
meet them half way: taint pic.
I'm also in favor of butt pic.
Go against the grain and send a butt pic .
Jon pls send dic pic and post results.
Gotta make a move Jon, I grow weary of this flirty game.
95% of the time I say that its not hilarious. 
Yeah but dragos is an expert in butts. Conflicting expertise .
I'm an expert in this area.
Is that even a nurse? Those don't look like scrubs.

There's 100% pussy in my breathable air .
http://www.shallowwaterblackoutprevention.org/.
Idea: too many messages too fast during a workday and sun yells at us.
Fire burns up O2.
Yeah that's true Woody, but there still is 21.9% O2 in our breathable air.
Whatchu got there chemistry? 
omg mike.
yea but the air in a fire isn't completely CO2, its mostly nitrogen right? Isn't that what most of the air is?
What's that in quarts.
if you inhale 2L of CO2 and you're O2 deprived, your lungs can't just extract the O2 from the CO2.
I'm pretty sure it is.
that isn't even close to how lungs work.
I'm not sure that's how lungs work, but I don't know enough to refute you.
You need something in lung to absorb CO2, even if there is no oxygen in the air.
don't need to do it at the surface.
you can exhale underwater.
Andy that's you're strategy for everything.
But the desire to breathe isn't caused by lack of oxygen, its amount of CO2, so exhaling would still work.
Ez mid.
I would just get naked.
Maybe you are fat boy.
you're sinking right to the bottom.
tuxedo you're toast.
If I fall in titanic style, I'd be fine drowning cause I got to slam on Kate Winslet for a week .
Tuxedo.
Could always get naked.
ok. are we naked in the water? or did we just fall in titanic style in a tuxedo?
I'd pull a dolphin and get some hang time.
welp.
you'd take a big breath of CO2 and then be like.
all the oxygen would be burned up.
no because you'd be surfacing in to fire.
Could you surface, grab a breath, then immediately dive again to stop the burning.
I'd go with my poop strategy before taking the early gg and drowning. 
either way you're suffocating.
as you broke the surface, you'd also get covered with oil and then start to burn with no way to extinguish it.
Matt's strategy: try to set new personal best at breath holding.
Plus being wet could maybe buy me some time? Is there like a ledge here or is this an infinity pool.
If I knew I was gonna drown I'd swallow as much water as possible just to get it over with.
I would probably brave the fire. The water is certain death, the oil only likely.
Well Jon would die .
More like "blubblub".
I would take a poop in the water, hope that the chemical breakdown of the poop mixed with the oil would break it down enough that it would spread away in a hole big enough for me to surface. 
I'd probably mutter, "shit" first.
I like where this is going.
what would you do?
and then someone spills oil on the surface and lights it up.
I'd probably pick water. Everyone else whose drowned can't be wrong right? I'm a follower.
say you're drowning.
I've heard drowning is pretty good.
>Well played!
Sorry.
Your mother didn't seem to mind it.
fuck that shit.
i think being eaten would be the worst.
Also drowning might be the worst way to die. I think I fear being curbstomped more. 
I'd also enslave him like jafar in Aladdin .
If that doesnt work you can always wish for more genies.
I bet you'd get a genie and wish for more wishes. 
I'd like to drown in a tank of water that's also filled with gillyweed from harry potter. Eat some of the gilly weed and boom, easy not die.
Oh and she's electric!
I said pussy :deal-with-it-dog:.
See jan.
my friends and I just went out for lunch and we got on the topic of drowning. The question came up, if we had to die by drowning, what would you choose to drown in?
Drowning in the pussy.
4 chords 2 hard 4 me.
It's the classic "sounds-difficult-but-is-incredibly-easy" song.
Its the douchebags who only learn wonderwall on the guitars fault .
Champagne Supernova is �.
I agree with Matt's stigma analysis.
What's the story morning glory, roll with it awesome songs.
I agree. There seems to be a fair amount of stigma because of wonderwall but I sat at listened to that album today and its really good.
One of the better rock bands to come out of the 2000s.
It's a shame that Wonderwall has become a huge joke, but their other stuff is super cool.
I think they're great.
What do you guys think of the band Oasis.

i don't know enough about my life to refute you.
mike also taught me how to be a better father.
moke grow up and make jokes.
both great ideas.
andy i introduced you to anita's breakfast burritos, the true meaning of love, taught you how to tie a bowline knot, and rescued you from that car acccident. and you're going to treat me like this?
or ask her why she doesn't just feed the cat a bunch of salt until it dies.
you should ask her why she hasn't drowned the kitty for not being a dog.
the girl who came to lotr is fostering a kitty named "salt", and it takes everything in my being to not make "salty?" jokes repeatedly.
Look at that house, xiao8 bought with all his TI4 money.

rapier confirmed best farming item.
he's top of networth now too.
yeah, people go for rapier too late sometimes. this was the right move.
WE WILL DEFEND THIS ANCIENT WITH OUR LIVES.
i agree with the pick. he's going for the fucking win when they need to.
is rapier the OP item this patch?
this is the most fucking baller as move i've ever seen.
ee's back must be sore.

but we'll see.
personally i think gyro is just gonna hit critical mass soon and then the game is gonna be over.
yeah, but they were ahead in that one.
the earthshaker is railing them in the ass each team fight.
'im just remembering the c9 sfz game that went on for ~forever when ee was on AM.
one amazing teamfight could put them back in it.
they've also have two fast farmers in the anti and lina. its possible to bring it back.
c9 is just trying to make space accross the map, and they're doing it pretty well.
its insane that this game is still going on.
> Relax, you're doing fine.
sorry.
you have enough free time to lose your wallet.
nerd!
that thing took some serious time. i have less free time this summer.
remember last year when andy made that googledoc of the whole round robin? that was cool.
Secret just needs to go into a dimly lit room for a little while, listen to some Nora Jones and have a glass of wine. They'll be alright.
3 points for a 2-0 win, 1 point for a 1-1 series and no points for 0-2.
top 4 teams in each of the two groups at the end of the round robin advance to winners bracket.
>mike continues to think he knows things about brackets.
no, these are 2 game series.
fnatic, it goes to game 3.
lost to who, and now what happens.
secret lost, thats an upset.
*plays Eye of the Tiger*.
nvm.
i will bet you $0.25 on that jon.
i'll call it now. C9 comes back and wins this game on the back of the anti-mage.

razor's right clicks are pretty darn good if you get a long damage drain off.
c9 had so much utility but no proper right click to actually beat someone down.
ember kept surviving every fight and getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
thats what sing sing builds on ember (the blink not the linkens).
blinkens build was tight.
the blink of the ember.
>seppuku.
knew it.
razor did have an AC.
"let me link you... oh you're gone shoot".
unless you're going against someone like a bristle.
but he's pretty useless late game.
i guess razor has a little more lane presence, so he at least contributes in the early game.
slardar sucks.
i just think razor is like slardar- if you win a game with him, it's because of the other 4 heroes on your team.
cant explain that.
no i dont think so.
Didn't razor have an AC though?
a shivas wouldve gone a long way.
maybe AC?
you need something for attack speed.
dragos pls.
god a satanic refresher bkb rapier carry dazzul would be hilarious.

try that one as a beginner song woody.

Monastic silence.
you guys are uptight sexers .
thats the key.
you have to go with the rhythem of the music woody.
dead silence.
Music gets in my head and I get all out of rhythm .
No music or tv for me. I'm with Andy.
I was also sworn to silence regarding the GoldenEye fact but that girl is awful so yolo.
it looks like it is rocking a pompadour .
^pretty lil thing.
http://www.gschneiderphoto.com/gallery3/var/albums/birds/ducks/commongoldeneye/common_goldeneye-2667.jpg?m=1419979410.
brown eyes are a type of sex object.
#duckfacts.
Thanks matt.
Goldeneyes are a type of duck.
did you guild your dick and call it the golden gun?
do you also ask the girl at the end if she had fun?
I did get some action watching GoldenEye once. Would recommend. 
if your head isnt in the game then you're gonna do a piss poor job.
lil andy got adhd.
andy gotta focus to get ready.
music is okay, but i cant focus if there is something on screen.
i have to mute any tv or movie prior to sex.
it 100% is moke.
I don't think math is prepared to be used in this context.
weirdest movie i ever had sex to was V for Vendetta. I remember there's a scene where the Benny Hill theme is playing and it took me right out of the moment.
i know myself too well, the girl would just be angry because i would be mocking the movie the whole time.
i would not get laid if i watched that with someone.
lol dragos.
0 failures though!
woah you had sex with at least 5 different girls???
sty, that is none of your business.
I'm n = 1 success.
probably around there.
have you gotten laid 100% of the time you've watched it without someone too?
n = 5?
*what's.
what the sample size there?
and 100% of the time I've watched the notebook with someone I've gotten laid after so woodrow has a point.
rekt.
^gay!!!!
Girls will do anything after they watch that movie. Take a note.
Ah the Notebook. I've seen it.
her story is the most interesting and i think she is one of the most convincing actors this season.
#gif Rachel mcadams.
you are right in that rachel mcadams is by far the best character this season.
Also she hot.
I think the dialogue is pretty tough to compare between seasons because the themes are so different. The show is still incredibly dark, but the supernatural/religious element has been removed this season. All the characters are equally tortured, but display it in different ways. Rachel McAdams is OUT OF CONTROL good this season.
#gif hot international girls .
Is.
But that is the issue. True detective doesn't feel very authentic. Way too grand. Who knows though, I'm not a swamp land detective. Maybe that's how life it.
I agree, i just think you overestimate this season's dialogue.
Dialogue can be so useless or fake or just a filler but when it's done right it makes everything about the show / movie / book / play more believable and authentic.
And Woody, I'm such a sucker for good dialogue. It's what makes a good show great.
right on girl.

Sexually.
game was: quote 5+ words while watching futurama. liz and i... knew what we were doing.
mostly? not really.
hey andy remember that time you got spanked at futurama.
you dumb moke.
owen wilson.
Guy needs to chill the fuck out with those movie.
I don't like Wes Anderson .
who is he in the royal tenenbaums again? i totally dont remember.
I fucked up.
Wait.
?? Have you never seen royal tenenbaums? Man can act.
pretty sure he thought to himself "dazed and confused" was 20 years ago, time to do a new character, and then started acting.
Did mcconaughey just wake up one day and decide to just turn on the acting?
yeah, but at least matthew mccouneghey sells it. i just cant buy Vince Vaughn trying to be deep. In the scenes where he's being a gangster he does a really good job though.
Nobody talks like that (I'm only on season 1).
Also this is a family guy reference, I'm not a douche. True detective is a little too much though. It's like listening to a book on tape when they talk.
Shallow and pedantic .
I'm out.
Time to chime in. Watches are cool. Rick and Morty is great. True detective is good but it insists upon it self, very pedantic. Everyone get back to work.
you know what isn't pure crap though? rick and morty. can't wait for them to get to the episodes that haven't been leaked yet.
Last season was like best television ever until the last 2 episodes and then it became pure crap.
although i am skeptical of that claim.
but that's yet to be decided.
ok i will watch.
I'd argue better than last season.
Andy it's getting sooooooooo good.
#gif i dont get it.
#gif brink disney.
also i have decided that the brink is shitty.
i havent watched the most recent 2 episodes.
who's caught up on true detective? cause I watched that shit really hungover last night and I nearly had a panic attack / threw up.
but watch out.
i guess you win this time.
it's cloudy today and I have to work.
alright lets test this. go outside and fall asleep: when you wake up guess the time and report back.
I'm actually really good at that.
if you're outside just learn to tell the time by looking at the sky scrub.
It's way easier to work with a waterproof 30$ watch than it is to work with a $400 smartphone that can be ruined by any element.
I used to be anti-watch but after working outside so much having a watch is so much more convenient than carrying around a phone all the time.
boo time!
also watches in an age of smart phones.
daylight savings time is also stupid.
time zones == freedom.
dirty communist.
and China does that!
bet the pre game show starts soon though.
do you think it would ever make sense to get rid of time zones entirely and have people just get used to doing things at unusually numbered times in different places?
2 more hours of work fellas.
you are right, it's 12pm EST, 1pm AST.
yeah, idk. i just assumed they would start at 9am west coast time which is noon east coast and who knows what in your monopoly time.
Could be wrong though!
saying 50 mins on r/dota2, that's what I normally go by.
I think its not for 1 hour 50 min.

you should have tossed a pun his way as you walked by.
But do you know who he is?
That good justice feeling where he looks so foolish. Ahh it was so good. 
I made prolonged eye contact. I am so justice hard right now.
Slowly.
And he got to watch everyone board in front of him .
So they boarded him last.
He kept being like "do you know who I am" etc.
Some guy was causing a fuss about getting on the plane. Being loud and obnoxious. He paid for some boarding thing and they were telling him to wait.

isnt it just "slow and low".
I don't think someone just "figures out brisket". I feel like it took years to understand pork basics .
the only reason i like beef ribs is because i feel like fred flintstone.
Can you get it here by noonish?
Figure out brisket and then get me some.
I think brisket. 
This conversation is making me so hungry.
With more research and effort.
talkin what, brisket?
We should make some beef BBQ .
You got me.
yeah this scrub is using westlaw when google knows whats up.
Andy I googled like "Big Laws in 1882".  Get on my research game.
true, that was a very seat-of-the-pants beef adventure.
We gotta give beef another go. Initial tests very shaky .
Whatcha got there google? Try and get on my westlaw level. Also I guess you never heard of the Alien and Sedition acts?
i tell you what, im not very hype on most other bbq than pork.
Slaw is great. If you don't top pork BBQ sandwiches with slaw, you fucked up.
slaw is good.
if not laws, what about slaw.
Yea we only passed the first law restricting immigration that year, but I doubt laws are an important part of your research .
Side note, ways I know my research has gone astray: when I'm looking at a supreme court case from 1882.
i mean, in a "huh didn't expect that," way, not a "yup kaleidoscopes on acid" way.

i also took a pretty solid shit during wine night.
I did struggle through the Thai before wine night then take a fiery poop during wine night �.
i forgot you dont like spicy things so much.
Also sinus blowing.
I agree with mike. Cooking every meal is a bit much, not to mention I enjoy cooking for others, but if she has no interest in how rewarding and thoughtful the process of cooking food is...then girl, that's a deal breaka.
its mind blowing.
mike you;ve had liz's jumbalia.
I mean, pretty critical to life. May as well take some pride in it. 
food is pretty key.
Girl doesn't need to be cooking my every meal but if you don't care about food then who the fuck are you and why are you in my bed.

that is without a doubt my favorite food in the world.

Yes. That's just math v.

Thanks Woody I appreciate it.
That gif was what I needed to perk me up. Kudos.
I'll allow it. She's fine.
the camera guy knew exactly what he was doing. but you're right, we need woody's input.
Not gonna lie I'm going to need Woody's input to know.
thats just cool.

Wasn't one of your law school colleagues dating an 19 year old.

she would be at best a junior in hs.
a 24 year old friend? yes, absolutely.
q: would you think oddly of your friend if he hooked up with a girl who was 16 if it was legal?
in some states 16 is the age of consent, so jon is probably fine.
she was 16-19 when she was on Victorious, so we're riding a fine fine line here.

I thought maybe she was "phat" like, "damn Jon thinks that girls phat".
Interpolate Woody, must be a girl named Kat.
Also woody is dumb for not enjoying pokemon.
I too enjoy the whole process of storing wood. It's almost therapeutic. 

Also, Woody enjoys wood, how convenient.
Hat, bat, rat, Matt, ??? Scat?
#gif clam jam.
And carrying it.
I like stacking it.
chopping wood is fun.
I hate fun. I love taxes, time outs, hardtack, chopping wood, crunches, and stale cereal.
Does Woody like fun #?
I just wasn't that into it. 
Also Pokemon sucks. I'm sorry.
Also finding lost things.
I'm in Atlanta eating a fried clam sand which.

Andy Esposito changed the topic to: Stu Won't.
im at my job.
Get a job peasants.
It's like $50.
Holy shit, I dont think you have that kind of money.
^^^^!!!!
If stu responds to that too, i'll go on ebay and buy a first edition holographic charizard and mail it to him.
What is he gonna buy with it? Healthcare? You guys are giving it away.
 He doesnt want your monopoly money duckboy.
I'll give you a loonie too, Stu.
#remindme "30 minutes" give stu a dollar .
Stu answer this in the next half hour and I'll give you a dollar.
Now its gone, gone, gone.
#who lost that lovin feelin?
Suck it bitches.
terrible decision.
#who would mike trade last?

#who would mike trade first?
I'd trade any two of you for Stu's return.
I love stu. I wish he were talking in the groupme.
Pretty sure he is more into pokemon than anyone I know.
Stu really needs to get in on this convo.
Hitmonchan >.
Make it rain though with payday.
what a stupid pokemon.
I bet you jan likes Meowth.
I would think you'd like farfetch'd.
Articuno has always been my favourite pokemon... probably why I got interested in researching arctic birds.

First 150 are the best IMO.
Judgmental bitch.
What an amazing game. Can that be the next thing we do as a group? Just everyone gets pokemon games so we can battle and trade?
#gif so you're telling me theres a chance.
5% chance just sounds like a challenge to me.
Real men catch a pikachu in viridian forest.
You choose charmander because you're a man, and not afraid of challenges.
I constantly have dreams where pokemon are real and then I wake up and get sad.

The hunt for key ended with no key.
That doesnt even make sense.
#what is mike trying to get me to eat?

You'll see it on the subreddit sometime tonight. 
There's a tournament going on for it. And Trump just did the dumbest thing I've ever seen. 
Andy and Dragos. There's a new expansion for Hearthstone.
Not confidence inspiring.
#what best describes this girl's personality.

Low down gator investigator?

The latter is cooler.
Or ducks that go to space.
So you're saying we need to design spaceships that quack.
But ducks fly and spaceships fly so I guarantee I know what I'm talking about.
I'm a duck scientist tho so don't quote me.
You obvs need a window that can release for emergency landings on water or whatever.

That seems right but I don't know enough about spaceship design to refute it.
I feel like windows that can roll down is probably a design flaw.

The more someone uses the same emoji in their responses the more I associate that emoji with what I imagine your physical appearance is.

He's honestly good enough at arena that people might watch.

All the subtlety of a brick through a window.
I'll ask questions later .
also matt i said that cause she started the conversation how she hates phing and how that solution looked kinda gross ; so basically she was asking for it ; you spike the ball i smash it in cant be helped.
you mean bitches?
Walking a dog that wears sunglasses would definitely lure females.
"�" - this would work however .
"hey bae do u suk dik? also fuk jon amirite!!".
Dragos I understand what you said but I have no idea why you said it. Note: you cannot court a woman by talking to her like she's in this groupme.
I'm gonna have to ask more questions later though cause that was mad confusing .
Dragos! I'm proud of you too.
Ask if she likes her corn shucked and herself fucked.
Play with me!

Wear a pressed shirt.
No wait too aggressive. Go out for dinne.

"If your phone ever autocorrects "fuck" to "duck". It's ok it's still fowl language.".
Nice.
#gif civilization .
If real life were civ, Spanish and Japanese game shows would win cultural victories.
japanese copycats.
Wondering*.
I was watching .
In case anyone was wondering what I was watching.
Spanish television game show where blindfolded contestants in skimpy underwear try to guess what animal is crawling on them.
elaborate?
Disagree.
this guy is prob getting a bj under the table.
#gif drunk asian.
Jan pls.
Have mercy on your body.
Jon no.
Tim Saunders is in town. I'm obligated to drink a lot right now. Its like the last thing I wanted to do after last weekend .
Isn't chunky cheese for adults?
Drunk skeeball is an experience no one should go without.
It's like Chuck E Cheese but for adults.
What!?!?!
I've actually never been to a D&B.
Pick the right games and the points are priceless.
Woah. Pretty valuable.
I think you can play 4 or 5 games .
That will buy you 20 minutes. I assume the 175 player points are worthless.
I got $47 cash, and 175 player points on a card to Dave and Buster's.
I'll make it "app"en.
Give me $700,000 and I'll make it happen.
So like yik yak and Snapchat combined?
I'm not sure how it would work, but think bathroom graffiti, but on your phone. Like you sit down, open the app, and it puts you into I guess a random (graffiti) room (kinda like chat rooms) where you can draw and write whatever you want in real time with other people. Wanna draw a dick on that guys nice cat doodle? Do it. Bringing the bathroom graffiti back - smartphone style.
I just thought of a great app idea.
#gif doot doot.

Maybe for you.
There isn't a way.
As always we means mike.
I wish there was a way we could filter out shitty 3d text.
#gif mormons.
Oh man that's a good old fashioned #sunstrike.
sorry, no talking of mothers. and no touching of the hair or face.
your mother would be very happy.
I want an app that actually shows mature women in my area that would like to fuck.
Do some research. Weak Matt. 
Sitorsquat .
Toilet finder.
Already exists .
Gotta love stock photos.
Call the app "Porcelain Portal".
Jon, over and out. �.
I wish I had an app that would shut you the hell up.
Think of how many people would love that.
us "North Americans".
You should have an app kind of like yelp that tourists can use to locate the nicest toilet in an area for travellets.
However, this is not always the case. Some Asian countries will have business with real life toilets. The ones we're used to, that flush and you don't have to squat over a hole of filth.
Buckle up this sounds like a wild ride.
I'm tired of you saying 'us' Americans. Fuck off you Canadian fuck. 
Us spoiled Americans are used to riding porcelain ponies. When Americans enter an Asian bathroom and stare in horror at the hole in the floor that is to be their toilet, people are much less than impressed.
Good start.
Poop and puke, I like where this is going.
Which is great and all, but then comes the time when the drunk girls need to pile in to the bathroom or some dude has had too much noodles/beer/parasites and needs to go to the bathroom.
So, us pampered Americans love to travel through Asia and impoverished countries pretending to do relief work/volunteering while we're in our 20-somethings, but all everyone does/goes there for is to get super drunk and party and eat noodles for cheap.
Go on, my body is ready.

How amazing would that be?!
Yes. That is 100% what I'm trying to do.
*pitch wawa.
You're obviously gonna pitch me an app that lets me order and pay for a sandwhich and then just walk in and grab it, right?
This week we have a call with WaWa, FUNimation (which is Dragonball Z) and Comicon. It's like fucking app Christmas.

possible. was concerned about it being too noisy. not difficult though.
request: have sUN send initial confirmation? or is that too messy.
nitty gritty: it only checks every 12 minutes (i think) so i guess it could be at most ~~11 minutes late on response time. it should just reject any malformatted queries but coding is hard so DUNNO. 1 second cooldown because i can't seem to learn from my mistakes.

Carnation as an adjective can mean "skin color" which makes it a lot creepier.

And dragos should just be a typo already .
And the long lost brian.
We need one for matt and dragos.
So far weve got some pretty good name typos. Anfy, Moke, Woofy, Jan, Can, Stump.
At a certain point every word is gonna get replaced by a misspelling, and our groupchat will be unrecognizable as english.

Hi jan.
Hello everybody. 
Andy your lack of faith is comforting.
Im not worried about woofy though, he'll try and add a cd, break sun, and then mike will fix without adding cd.
naked butts are funner .
Slippery slopes sound fun.
Not sure if intentional response to woofy, or typo.
well we are all collectively butt naked on a slippery slope.
>what hell.
>anfy.
>anfy.
Haha that's what mike thinks. Rules > all FUCK YOU Anfy.
It would be hilarious is you disabled all cds.
In all things, humor > rules.
That was a clever enough usage to not merit bringing the secret police in.
Its had no cd for so long and I only just now took advantage of that fact, and it was for comedic value. Mike have a heart.
no kobe cd slip up; mike police mobilizing .
Kobe sucks at this, no number starts with 110.

Don't feel bad for me. I saw a beautifully constructed mechanical dragon turn to either side and breathe fire. 
I feel bad for anyone so delusional they don't even know what happened  .
I feel bad for anyone inattentive enough to miss them.
The time dragons gyrations were the highlight of the of the show .
But that moving dragon though.

Hows your remix to ignition?
Can you do Nelly covers.
We know ~2hrs of covers.
Woody, can I bring my band to play at your wedding?
I'm down for either but if we're doing the latter, I call white suit.
We could also do this ^.
I'll shave my head and be the krillin to your gohan Jon, plus I want to go to Woody's wedding.
Can I dress like that for your wedding woody ^.
Sun knows you won't have to but you will anyways.
Oh.

OK caught up now.
Lol I always do that too 😂.
like a shared experience, watching him like messages as we go.
so I'll just go back to that message and read with him.
and I'll learn he's behind.
Sometimes Matt will like an old message.
How about I just give you enough high fives until you forgive me. Like the Sims. 
Woody we established that groom order will be decide by the game of games: a test of strength, cunning and deception.
I expect a lot of drinking to move back up.
essentially all you guys are doing is moving yourselves down the Bridal Party power rankings.
Can't tonight. Sometime later this week though. 
Meepo*.
I'm off for the next two days, anybody want to play doto tonight, I'm gonna play keeps.
Unless its from amazon, anyone who sends me mail can eat a dick. Except for mike, who sends me cool 3D printing things. And I guess woody. 
Or hashtag a inter-gram?
You couldnt tweet me an e-vite?
Mail is fucking stupid. 
I feel vindicated.
No sight. I'll check my apartment later. Woops.  .

I need to know if I'm free the 27th and 28th. A friend wants to to feed/water her mice.
Woody, answer the wedding question, is there something going on this month?

Woody pls advise.
Could be but woofy is the domain expert on emojis now.

Side note, has any rapper ever used the phrase "turn on a dime" as a double entendre? I thought of it the other day, but it seems really obvious so I doubt it hasnt been used in a song.

Mike also doesn't respect women's rights.
#WHOM do you love the most.

Could you be loved, sUN#?

Could you be ported sUN #?

Yeah with jak, wr and clinkz they have a lot of push.
Jak for seige though.
At least they have es and qop for highground defence.
C9 starting big momentum.
Dgaf.
At least he got 6.
Holy shit he died 5 times already.
20 min midas op.
Aa net worth 800 @ 10 min.
Yeah it looks like ee is putting in work. He rotated early out of safelane.
Ember snowballing hard.

Woody and sUN were right, I cannot stream this. I found a site with a bunch of live stats though so I'm watching that.
Bloody early game so many miles.

Lesh kills qop solo mud.
Eg first blood double kill.
This is gonna be sweet.
C9 (lesh aa jak ember windrunner) eg (tusk qop shakira skywrath clinkz).

Homework is for nerds.

So you're sayings there's a chance!
I have to catch up on my class lectures and homework but perhaps if I get sick of it.
Then I maintain tusk, but also predict snowballing heroes.
The new meta is all chat pun teams.
Or has the meta shifted since then?
Predictions: tusk as first pick/ban. Lesh picked or banned in first two rounds.
...i cant say I ever played that.
Pregame music is lousy. Reminiscent of the super Nintendo lion king game.

I'll keep you updated Andy.

I got the animal care permits for my test species (me) so we're all good.
Is this an ethical study.
And another cool finding of this work is that it always ends in stitches too. It's the things you don't expect to find that make science very special.
gotta get more replicates.
So far I have a n=2 with two positive results.

Stitches come out in 3 weeks. The main risk now is an infection so I'm on antibiotics.
The doctor said I'm going to need ~5 weeks for recovery.

But what about musketmen? 
Pyro kills spies which kill snipers who kill medics who heal heavys who get killed by demo man who are themselves bad against scouts who are good against everyone slow but die to engineers. Also ubers and soldiers jumping around  .
Woody makes a good point, I do know very little about this game.
Plus it's fun playing a game I know more about that Andy.
Ez greatness. 
Tf2 is great #?

The correct way to do that is.

That reminds me of the time I poisened a bunch of ducks with d15N and d13C and let them fly into some Candian Bay.
jawesome.
The Bay of Fundy, Canada, is a macrotidal bay
with a highly productive intertidal zone, hosting a large abundance and
diversity of marine invertebrates. We analysed trace element concentrations and
stable isotopic values of d15N
and d13C in 14 species of
benthic marine invertebrates from the Bay of Fundy’s intertidal zone to
investigate bioaccumulation or biodilution of trace elements in the lower level
of this marine food web. Barnacles (Balanus
balanus) consistently had significantly higher concentrations of trace
elements compared to the other species studied, but otherwise we found low concentrations
of non-essential trace elements. In the range of trophic levels that we
studied, we found limited evidence of bioaccumulation or biodilution of trace
elements across species.
what's the abstract?
awesome!
I just submitted a paper for publication so I think today is going alright.

Attachments of type emoji rely on data from emoji PowerUps.

Clients use a placeholder character in the message text and specify a replacement charmap to substitute emoji characters

The character map is an array of arrays containing rune data ([[{pack_id,offset}],...]).

The placeholder should be a high-point/invisible UTF-8 character.

I still read them whenever I go home.
liz painted me a water color calvin and hobbes scene for my birthday one year.
I've got all the C & H books back in my parent's house.
I always entertain the idea of getting a tattoo, but It'd have to mean something special like that as well.
Love of c & h runs in the family.
Yea, my dad had Calvin holding a baseball bat in the same place. Got this after he passed away.
sick tat.
thats sick.
Btw Jon I just saw where you sketched Calvin and Hobbes on IG, This is my tattoo.
and they analyze the video footage of his rival and it turns out that he's actually running because he's leaving the ground by like 1mm between strides.

Jons legs confirms ipod.
Do you constantly shuffle?
if you never lift them then how do you walk?
I actually just have oddly muscular legs, and usually never feel like I need to lift them. 
Never.
I am always team skip leg day .
Cam grow up.
Yesterday was leg day. I'm not sure I can get out of bed.
Who knows, if I still end up talking to this girl later then I'll let you guys know more.
snapchat pls.
I dunno how I can get a photo of her now. I should've sent a photo earlier .
Sorry *maiden with the flaxen hair*.
Jon where can I find pics of this vegan with hair on her pits, aka the girl with the flaxen hair.
although we breifly crossed into wv.
w/e.
it was southwest virginia btw.
He could have a podcast. I'd listen.
Just so I could hear about it. 
Yeah, I wish Andy had to do that every week. 
Remember when Andy drove through WV with a bunch of middle-aged women? That was funny.
you don't need to eat steak to bang your cousin.
meth*.
and method .
also strip clubs.
i thought they just had cousin banging.
does west virginia have vegan?
The photo class is a bunch of girls and me. I have played music each day and have swooned basically all of them. 
That means she creeped you cause she was interested.
Then, ashamed, deleted her Facebook.
oooooooooh! She friended you!
I didn't ask. She just friended me on Facebook one day. 
hippies love their IG.
she on Instagram?
Hipsterrrrrr.
running from her past, undoubtedly.
she actually deleted her Facebook recently. Unknown reasons. 
for science, of course.
She's going to this music festival in WV this weekend so, I'll prob take her to this vegan restaurant sometime next week .
do you have a picture of her?
Its interesting. Its definitely limiting my pursuit but it isn't breaking the deal. 
Armpit hair wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me.
no, straight and clean well kept hair. Including on her armpits. 
Does she have dreadlocks?
Jon, this girl is definitely a huge hippie. She probably loves Phish and Jefferson Airplane.
Then throw them one of these bad boys, �.
*at.
And the end of the day its all about calories though. Keto just made it easier to keep my calorie count low.
you tell those people to fuck off .
Its really effective. I lost 20 lbs in 2 months. Some people criticize it though for helping you lose weight quickly early on and then slowing down.
I think my brother did keto for a while and he lost a ton of weight.
I like cheese more than fruit.
Similar to paleo, but switch fruit for dairy.
No fruit or carbs, lots of meat and dairy.
Its like the opposite of vegan.
Pescatarians are vegetarians but they eat fish.
andy, what was involved in the keto thing you did a few years ago?
Where as vegitarians only dont eat things which would kill the animal.
Yeah so basically they don't like delicious things. Except hummus. 
If its the latter jon is right. No diary, eggs or any other delicious animal products.
Too lazy to Google. Not a joke. 
yeah. fuck did i walk into that.
Or are you actually asking?
Is this the setup to a joke?
nothing from animals.
What separates vegans from vegetarians?
unsure. I remember she laughed hard when I made a joke about all my campmates at firefly tripping on acid though. I was like, well I guess she gets it.
Weed?
It's all starting to fit though...armpits, likes the grateful dead, is vegan.
> Well played!
The question is whether she will eat your meat.
armpit girl is also a vegan I learned. Don't understand vegans. 
I tend to binge an artist.
I was like 'nice.'.

something about cream cheese with rice always didn't sound great to me.

All sounds well and good until you ask the tough questions.
How long has it been back there? What state is it in?
Dude it's chick fil a. That's not so gross.
You really need to clean your ears jon, thats gross.

There arent any nearby. There's a trick that is sometimes near my school, but thats not where I am today.
And it's not even Sunday. You have the power Andy.
I want chik fil a so bad now.
So no worries. Just give me a spicy chicken sandwich from chik fil a and we'll call it a day .
Jon makes a good point, if the statements are true then you're off the hook.
But in general libel/defamation is way harder to sue for in the US then in europe.
That is the truth though. 
So if I printed something saying jon was a rapist, he wouldnt have to prove that I maliciously intended to hurt his reputation, just that I printed it without giving a fuck about the truth.
http://gamecola.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/words.jpg.
You can sue for defamation as a private individual and the standard is mere negligence, but you need to prove actual malice for public figures.
Everything.
Follow-up question: what's love got to do with it?
Standard for defamation is different for public figures because you out yourself out there.
Interesting. What does being a public figure have to do with it?
Could he sue? Yes. Would he win? Almost certainly not.
Probably, but since he's a public figure you would have to prove malice, which is unlikely.
If he gets raided and it comes out they were looking for child porn, but they find nothing, could he sue for damages? To his image and all.
�.
Unless you're a cowboy cop.
True. Also you have to assume they have something pretty solid to go on if they are gonna raid the house of someone and say its for child porn. Even the implication that someone has it is super damaging so hopefully law enforcement wouldn't do it all willy nilly.
Yea I mean I guess with his past there's pretty good reasoning to check him.
So according to official statements it might just be that they are investigating him because a guy he worked with had child porn. Wonder if they find anything.

Visited two haircut places. Both had closed (permanently). Not sure I'm getting a haircut today.
Do you use honey or vinegar or something?
Also. I haven't used shampoo in over a year and my hair has never felt better and my dandruff is gone.
I get my hair did like every 3 months. Whenever it becomes long enough to bug me.
jon im not sure that was a paraphrase, seems more like a direct quote.
>15 Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you won’t confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven’t told me the secret of your great strength.”16 With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was sick to death of it.
pretty much. Considering how many times he lied and she tried the thing he lied about, it was pretty obvious what was gonna happen.
That story literally says that Delilah nagged him so much he just gave up.

Shit there are bible stories about how long hair makes you awesome. Why disobey the old testament.
I know you Andy. I do the same. Cut for homecoming, cut for prom. Shaggy for lax, shaggy for summer ez. 
Very different lol .
We are very much opposites on this.
I get my hair cut every 2 weeks. Sometimes a week and a half. 
Usually one step above buzz cut. Not close but pretty short. The I wait 6 months and do it again.
I don't... Close haircuts... No. No. What if you want to lax? Are you going to lax with short hair? That's preposterous. 
How often would you say you get your hair cut?
*right.
Its hard to argue with or even understand that, so you're probably rught.
Black barbershops OP. Not only do you interact with people that kind of scare you, you get the added bonus that they're also super fucking good at close cuts. 
But your hair is dead. Germs make things dead. So your hair is probably riddled with riddles.
I mean, i dont think the germs are in my hair. And i'll probably get shampooed first. But at the same time, the fact that I have to ask maybe tells me the answer. I really have to get a haircut though.
I don't know enough about how germs work to say.
Is it unethical to get a haircut when I am a little sick?

Classic Liz can't estimate weight.
Im just paraphrasing what she said. She was in New Hampshire so they would probably be from canada.
what kind of loon weigh 50 pounds.
She was scared of being attacked by 50 pound loons. She said that they might hit her liver after attacking her "soft underbelly".
Is Liz looking to hunt loons with her bear family?
I thought loons just weren't to be disturbed and you're ok. They were endangered / protected in Vermont so we just gave them their leeway.
And the only reason these birds congregate in cities is because dumbasses like to feed them all the stale bread they have lying around.

The -ly rule applies in general, there are exceptions. The adverb for holy would be holily. 
#sunstrike.
Idk let's ask Jon.
Can you fail the SAT? I thought you got a number.
I have coworkers who said they'd probably fail it. I would think not.
Holy means you're wrong as fuck matt.
Tom bought 2 apples type of shit I'm all over.
I think.
Calc wasnt on there.
It was basic shit, but sometimes worded tricky.
I guess I could do the math? How hard was it. I don't remember calculus much.
It doesn't come up much at work.
E.g. Matthew eloquently explained for his dimwitted friend.
E.g. Woody foolishly admitted he doesn't know what an adverb is.
They kind of answer the how/when/ to what extent/ of something that has happened.
Sneakily.
Quietly.
Quickly.
Anything ending in -ly woody.
Also I would fail the fuck out of the SATs. I don't know what an adverb is.
Jon. I leave my computer for the night and now you tf2!! NOW?!
They use the sat in canada?
If I took the SAT right now I'd do infinitely better than how I did in high school.
i could.
Can anyone TF2 tonight?
only because i know the lsat is way harder for the relevant corresponding sections.
yes and it would probably be close.
Q:  do you think you could pass the SAT today, and if so, with a better score than in high school.

since i'm bored at work.
Since when do you quibble about jokes making sense.
thats doesnt even make sense.
its a gull mike.
Should have held it up and said "I'm dovin' it".
shoulda asked if he wanted to grab a big mac afterwards.
thats pretty (g?)narley.
The dude almost passed out.
So I'm dissecting the thing and open its stomach and find a fucking cheeseburger wrapper from McDonald's in it.
And the whole process is pretty gruesome, and the photographer was getting visibly uncomfortable.
So there were like photographers there and stuff.
Just dissected a gull with the minister of natural resources from NS for this publicity event.
Holy fuck.
Donut do anything at all.
also, homer blows oatmeal out his nose.
homer knows how to spend a work day.
#gif work it.
#gif activia.
Even Jamie Lee Curtis's digestive system aint that active.
Active digestive system. 
Sometimes I wonder if Woody lives off a diet of beans and rotting raccoon carcases. Then I remember, no, those things wouldn't make his farts smell as bad as they do now.
^erica's wedding present.
�.
💨.
Did you �.
can confirm, have smelled woodys farts.
It was great.
Also. Yesterday I farted in target and the guy next to me had to leave the aisle .
I thought this was a 9-5 safe zone.
The guy next to me actually made an audible noise.
I'm on a fucking plane.
Jesus dragos.
should've just sent her this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
she texted me all these things and I was like, I care maybe.
lol wut.
no, that story happened last night.
Can confirm, have seen Jon play basketball.
shes very very good looking, but also bat shit crazy.
so, were you her rebound?
The last girl I was seriously talking to caught her boyfriend, that she lived with, cheating on her with some chick he found on craigslist.
Never mind I'm lying but the truth never got in the way of my jokes.
Can confirm, met Jon's last girlfriend.
you never do anything fun.
jon pls.
Just to get in her head of what she thinks she's matched up against.
� no.
also, Jon can we see your tinder profile for reference?
\         >.<.
wat.
>.<.
Jon just send her a few of these too.

Hey.
http://i.imgur.com/IpzaPnv.gif.
speaking of kung fu one of my favorite gif VERY NFSW.
will do.
Pls report results.
I ended up sending the kung fu gif with an asian emoji.
I guess events only let you do up/down voting, no real poll.
as it is we can just do stuff with events.
i wish groupme had a poll feature so we could get people to vote on things.
one of them is bound to work.
i say jon takes the shotgun approach and sends every suggestion in quick succession.
it always goes back to dick pics.
ooooo.
you know whats the opposite of classic asian fake tan.
A picture is worth 1000 words Jon.
"you know what they say about asian guys? No? Good. Don't ask.".
🏄.
and then switch to grindr.
"are you mulon, because I'll make a man out of you".
This is a scenario that doesn't need success. We need gasps. 
🏊 I'm swimming in pussy.
More like "successful".
Try hard ^.
Maybe make some Disney references. I could see that working. 
Underappreciated emoji's wood.
can't put your dick in a college degree woody.
But looks like 50/50 she won't know what Pearl Harbor was...
holy shitnuts this is too funny, i have to leave this chat so im not laughing audibly at work.
Well Andys got it.
"you want revenge for pearl harbor? I'll lie down and you blow the hell out of  me.".
🕡🔜🕛.
Then send the Godzilla emoji.
i like where your head is at mike, but the delivery could use some work.
"would you like to eat some asian for lunch? no? what if this asian ate you?".
>switch a too.
The ole switch a too.
No, ask her Andys question but then turn it into a deep family tree discussion. 
"my junk is already at half mast".
and that ask if she'd like to.
wait, asians had boats named junks.
ask her if she's got any asian in her.
I don't like her stalling.
Tell her "look I'm already half mast, are we doing this?".
you can do it jon, believe in yourself.
I wish I could send that .
send that gif.
#gif bitches.
�.
ok, i honetly think the emjo thing might be best.
#gif bitches love.
just an emoji in the shape of some asian country.
👲.
bitches love emojis.
can you send just an asian emoji?
jon is she wearing a dark green jacket in any of her photos.
Pumpkin Spice Lattes.
barber jackets?
unknowingly benefiting from generations of racial privilege?
Ugg boots?
no I wish it had gifs. 
drinking starbucks frappchinos?
I'm at the gate. If I miss it now it will be because I got lost in Jons sad love life.
jon can you respond on tinder using gifs only.
what are classic white girl things?
ez confidence.
I'll make it.
also, woody, is that the adult version of being late for the school bus?
jon i had to leave the room... that gif is too funny.
did you make the flight?
I was walking to work wen I realized I had a flight this morning. Ran back, grabbed clothes and drove to the airport. It's like the worst Monday.
gurl you whiter than colonel sanders himself.
I like the idea though.
ok.
we can do better .
i think you should respond "I wanna touch the hiney" in all asian characters.
sUN are you, by any chance... a pleasure bot#?
believe!
sun is still holding out hope for you mike.
sUN! 
exactly, so that's why I wanted to throw the groups big guns in.
i will end up old and alone, but my tombstone will read "#worth".
so now that pressures off, lets think of some hilarious things.
i want andy to guide all of my romantic decisions.
alright, she lives 48 miles away, so the important thing is you have really nothing to lose here.
That's some classic Asian stuff.
yeah nothing to her, just some white girl .
Quote sun tzu's art of war.
and i assume she's white?
whats in her pictures/profile.
what are her details.
I'm trying to come up with something clever to say but I'm drawing nothing. 
A girl I matched with on Tinder this morning just messaged me, "Asian, classic".
If I had more, I would. 
Are you just gonna start posting pics of kids with academic quotes on top of them?
http://cdn2.crushable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/honeybooboogif.gif.

#gif blind leading the blind.
I'm just getting over my hangover.
sorry dad.
You guys are bad drinkers.
on my back from the beach. still hungover.
Mike? A.
your mistake was trusting me. ask mike how that ended for him when he was in dc a few weeks ago.
The desire for pizza was high and you led us astray.
in my defense i was drinking for like 12 hours.
i have spent today nursing my hangover.
i dont recall a lot of last night.
#gif that happened.
No lets just walk around DC for 20 minutes.
Hey Andy wanna grab pizza?
#gif butts.

Who wants to TF2 or civ tonight? Game night?

TV has been telling you to drink responsibly for years, and you can't take even a little responsibility.

Take responsibility.

Ez hitchhiking.
Update: my bud was driving by and picked me up 2 minutes in to my walk.
Ez dick.
Omw home from work to find some dick apparently.
Together forever .
Andy. We will be together. This I promise. I need time to move this group. They are like molasses .
Are you walking to a party and looking to hitch hike?
#kobe, what are my odds /10 of getting picked up by a hitchhiker to this party?
Ez.
Do any of the words Andy is saying make sense#?
Balls in your court.
But actually woody. Think about who you are with. Will you get lots of chances to see them again? How many times do you come to dc? When you do come to dc do you hit me up, or do you randomly and inexplicably decide to hit up david? How much have i decided to tell my friends about you?
Cam leave wherever you are and find yourself a dick.
All a about cam.

>getting dunk.
I'm getting dunk again tonight. Going to my first wedding reception ever. I don't even know the bride and groom, I'm just playing in the band. #liquorhead.
jon, you do you.
andy i expect reports on how drunk woody is.
woody i expect reports on how drunk andy is.
 For the donkey.
Very.
It was.
i feel like watching that would be uncomfortable.
I watched your mom blow a donkey.
I've got like one more week of doto then I'm up north all summer.
to be fair, though- mostly fub.
And also fun.
Doto is so much fub.
doto, not even a second time.
i've been considering it, but avoiding actually playing dotoo.
Watching is the gateway drug to playing.
i think the kids call it "edging".
not playing, just watching.
No doto for me. Home in the sticks.
Wat.

No, you just walk pass it.
Jon, games. Chip chop lets go.
When you pass the bar, do you go to a bar to celebrate?

WE DIDN'T LISTEN.
Are you saying that I got so wrapped up in what I could do, that I never thought to ask what I should do?
There is a difference between "can" and "should", Andy.
Anal sex isnt one of those things.
Well at least now we know.
some things you just can't force.
yea, now I know what rape feels like.
this feels wrong. pulling the ripcord.
I need to punder what I've done.
These are punderwhelming.
i dont punderstand what you're getting at.
I think it should come naturally.
Is a pun thread something that can be forced?
i think woody would be #punable to participate in this.

I feel like starting a fire would be sleeper op.
I'm bringing whipped cream so i can fake foaming at the mouth.
Duh.
The secret is to fake a medical emergency woody.
The secret is to threaten a lawsuit!

haha yea.
Maybe. Maybe it's just an effect of how every conversation is so stilted in his movies that some just come out funny.
I think that's the whole point, but no one gets it.
Dude that movie is hilarious.
Tell me you guys see the odd humor in his movies as well? I was laughing so often during Budapest in theater and got dirty looks from the lady in front of me.
Budapest hotellllll.
Hint: any three of Anderson's movies.
Wait shit.
Life aquatic, royal tenenbaums, moonrise kingdom.
and make them into a trilogy or whatever.
take 2-3 movies with the same actor/actress.
wait this is my favorite game.
Hahahahahhahahahha that's the best theory I've ever heard.
after such an extraordinary event ed norton finds little meaning to life and descends into madness.
Regardless, even if I don't understand it, his style and (maybe unintentional) humor are awesome.
for real though the movie is just a prequel to Fight Club.
Love, at least as much as is possible for wes Anderson.
that def played to my experience.
I went and saw moonrise in theaters by myself.
I thought the two children are fairly mutually in live.
Binoculars. Love. Hurricane.

Moonrise is Tite.
I live his films but I don't understand moonrise.

woody remember when we went and saw Wall-E and that bus almost tipped over? the song strawberry swing was playing from that album in the background while we drove in and also saw that shit. Perfect day.
thats awesome. It's sick when albums do that. One coldplay album reminds me specifically of junior year of high school summer a lot. I don't necessarily like the album all that much now but it has some great memories in it.
i listened to that album all summer with my brother training for soccer preseason. good times.
yeah, definitely has that vibe. If only someone could get back to that feeling he had.
not him obviously but the beat.
and jon it sounds kinda like kanye from graduation.

both good though.
2nd was better, you're right.
If a rapper was able to effectively use beats like this, i'd be so happy.

1st was funny.
The second episode is better IMO.
lol i'd play that Roy arcade game.
omg this second episode is starting so sad.
will give thoughts in 20 min.
watching 1st episode right now.
watching the second episode now.
My favorite part of Rick and Morty is just the really vulgar short lines between rick and morty.
It comes for us all.
Humour.
when the fucking native american showed up matt, I lost it.
i grew to enjoy this episode.

i would roast matt with my hot iron.
#gif there it is.
not a lot of broth.
maybe a little broth.
And on Canada day too.
Rude.
roast in broth?
I would roast matt with some potatoes, onions, and in chicken broth.
im not sure 30 minutes is long enough, but i figure you just toss it in there and taste it at 30 minutes and do that every 5 minutes until its ready.
There it is.
hey matt why dont you go jump in the oven with some olive oil and garlic and rosemary at like 400 deg for like 30 minutes.
Jon's heart checklist: 1.) Is it a dragos gif request 2.) Is it a hot chick 3.) Did mike send the message 4.) Is matt getting roasted 5.) Is it a short and nonsensical message .
Gay!
jon did you ever buy that ukulele? i love mine.
If I could have bet somebody $100 that gif would get a like from Jon, I totally would have.

Jon. That reference. 
Im with jon. I dont mind going to a baseball game because its just day drinking, but otherwise that shit is dull as hell.
At least you can learn something that way.
Even then I'd rather watch Joel Osteen's sermons on PBS. 
You gotta be in the laziest mood of all time to want to do that at home. 
Beer you dummy.
I'm still thinking about how its possible that someone could enjoy watching a baseball game. 
And a jean vest.
Not enough mileage out of that gif yet.
Maybe with a red white and blue doo-rag.
Someone needs to make a USA version of that dog for the 4th.
Valid point jon.
Respond with that ^.

I dont know how to respond to matt.
I hate baseball, but I also hate people insulting america.
Americans national pass time blows.
I agree with jan.

Everyone is on the same team and you fight waves of robots.
Man vs machine is fun.
Maybe I'll start playing TF2 so I can play games with you guys again.
being a good medic has nuance.
Scout, Spy, Solider, Demo are the hardest to me..in that order .
Which are all the ones I play.
I think all classes are hard except Medic, Heavy, sniper. 
he requires more accuracy than I always think.
I actually find soldier difficult too. Hard for me to play that class efficiently. 
yea worth it to try if company will pay for it.
ive never understood the 3d mouse and i CAD all the time. maybe ill convince boss to buy me one to find out.

If those are good point it explains why I'm getting married and you are fondling ducks.
Jon makes some good points Woodrow.
Home buying is going bad. We are renting.
free bras for the lady.
just live in a shack and cut open coconuts for a living woody. 
how is the home buying?
New Job responsibilities + wedding planning + lady moving in + home buying = no Dota .
reality is a harsh mistress.
why did everyone quit dota again? lack of self control and a tendency to run away from responsibility?
this is happening right now in europe cause of a heat wave ; whos. in.
how many of us, and for how long.
I give my word.
I'll play meepo for 5 unranked games straight if you guys come back to dota.
pretty good disguise woody though you cant hide the arian in you.
Probably will not be able to play until at least 630.
#gif girl spy.

Stern is right.
we should play spy party.

we do some Man vs Machine TF2 tonight as a test.
i think i just want mario party mini games.
then once jon and i did some medic heavy shit and jon got hyped.
i dont understand TF2, i just die a lot.
But if people are in for starcraft I could do it.
agreed.
also mike you are slowly arguing for tf2.
Age of empires is so much lower skill i think.
starcraft (2) would take a significant amount of ramp-up time, which could lead into another dota situation.
More Vespene Gas!
wrong.
Starcraft! build units, fight them. pew pew.
i think it has to be a low skill floor game.
do better?
That was back when I used to play on a trackpad.
skill > riches, bitches.
but somehow everytime we fought you lost...
Minecraft got to the point where Andy and I had a surplus of every resource and built everything we ever imagined. We essentially beat an unbeatable game. 
or Starcraft 2.
Id rather do Starcraft.
?
age of empires 2.
Farming simulator 15 has multiplayer.
we need like a mario-party grade steam game.
i dont understand TF2, civ takes too long.
Minecraft?
I miss everyone. Can we do some game night soon? TF2, Civ, anything new besides Dota.
i am omniknight.
I will also come out of hibernation to play that.
I will download and struggle through a game to play that game.

Instead of tackling the other guy do you just apologize.
You have to say sorry after ever down.
You can score a single point if you punt the ball out of the opposing teams endzone.
what are other Canadian rules.
And a larger ball.
lol.
And a 110 yard field.
Yup.
did you only ever have 3 downs?
booooooo.
I played football for 7 years so yeah.

I'd love to throw a football today. Matt do you know how to throw a football you Canadian bitch?
Oh snap!
The first two episodes of the new season of Rick and Morty have been leaked.

I don't give a shit about things that died on their way to my mouth. 
Lots of animals are tortured, I'm not going to get hungup on one specific example.
Wow, thats pretty terrible. I guess I can add that to foods i wont eat. 
but it's a scientific fact that the tastiness of meat is directly related to how much the animal suffered on its way to your plate.
duh and/or hello yeah of course its shitty.
It's incredibly cruel.
Wow foie gras seems mean now after a google search.
foie gras is a thing, confirmed.
Diabetic duck?
Maybe next winter.
Is that what that is?
Go!
Ready...
Well, foie gras is a thing.
Alright matt, you job is to make duck beer with real duck.
And if future farmers would ever intentionally give their animals diabetes.
Ducks will definitely eat hops.
I wonder if diabetic animals taste better.
fois gras with hops?
Matt, will ducks eat hops? 
Kevin changed the topic to: If the person is a diabetic the process of whisky to urine is reverseable.
So maybe diabetic ducks?
best sentence 2k15.
If the person is a diabetic the process of whisky to urine is reverseable.
you sure you don't got that backwards?
But thats probably unrelated.
You can make whisky out of urine.
but it'll blast your eardrums out.
brb, google.
Can you make beer directly from ducks? is meat beer a thing?
matt are you allowed to drink goose island beers.
NOT ME!
if i had a gun and two bullets and was in a room with osama bin ladin, hitler, and matt, i'd shoot matt twice.

And even if it was possible, I probably dont have access.
Wat.
I wouldnt even know how to start doing that.
I assume you can look up matt as well because of nsa shit.
Andy can you look up which one of us pays the most taxes.
What you should actually do is look up tax protester and sovereign citizen literature. The IRS loves receiving that. Did you know that you can redeem your birth certificate for billions?
Big brother really cares.
You should send them your feelings. I guarantee they will be taken seriously and deeply considered .
For the record, the IRS took the money, but asked me to correct the return. I feel like if you take the money I should be done with the whole thing.
Looking at you woofy.
I'm in the civil division now. I cant send you to prison but I can sue you and repossess your shit if you fuck up your taxes.

Just because I don't run don't mean I don't cardio baby.

i wanna be a bitch.

Word, i'm glad I have a goal now. That goal is to make woody and mike feel like bitches.
I'm always available to talk about your running routine if you ever need it. But it's not as daunting as it initially sounds, you'll be fine.
If the app I'm using is right, I should be able to run a 5k in 5 weeks. That seems too slow though. I may need to up the pace to 4 runs a week.
K, i'll skype you at some point and discuss details further. But i'll sign up at some point this week.
Lets do it.
But ok.
The correct answer was aim for the bushes.
I'm down; its always a great experience. It's something to keep you honest during the summer. Always very fulfilling when you're done.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Okay, so its narrowing down to you and me andy lol.
Well I'll be in Tennessee so no.
Heres the site so you can check it out more: http://www.navyhalf.com/.
Running sucks. Fuck running. 
Sun said i could do it so I'm in.
well it seems to be the only half thats around the time that makes sense. I think i'll sign up, Andy, Stu, Mike etc. you guys interested?
Are you dancing to remix to ignition with your mom?
You must be swift as the raging river.
Woody, counterpoint: be a man.
I don't want to be limping I wanna be dancing out there.
It could ruin the foot stuff him and erica have planned for the honey moon.
"If anyone has any reason why these two shouldn't be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace."

"LOOK AT HIS FUCKING FEET! THEYRE FILTHY!".
Yea I'm not going to do it. I'm no fool.
hm...i'd rather you not run. It's risking potential injury etc for wedding day woody.
Counter points:

1) As long as you don't tell people you're in pain from running in a half-marathon, people will think you did something super manly to merit being in such severe pain.

2) Who looks at feet at a wedding?
September 26th.
I would need to check my cal, I'm in Chicago .
Thats six days before.
When is your wedding woody?
Woody, does the date make sense time wise for you?
2) my feet were destroyed. 
Im in.
I've pretty much done that and 1) you don't look tough you look like a bitch.
I only just started running again. Could I be ready for a half marathon by the end of September #?
Woody, don't train for the marathon, and then run it so you look tough as fuck during your wedding.
lol don't do that ^.
If you don't train but power through the pain, multiple weeks.
If you're trAined, Jons answer.
No no.
I dunno probably a day of rest and you're alright.
#gif dilf.

Andy I don't need your beltway insider math.
I'll do research and look at reviews etc. then report back. I'm just gonna be looking in the DC area since that's what makes the most sense.
<3 duckboy.
ITS MONDAY.
DC is probably ok.
oops.
oh.
I'll let you think about that logic matt.
but you have to come back after you run it, Andy.
13.1 mike. Its a half.
No further than 26.2 miles away.
If we do dc people can stay at my place.
Is DC near enough for you woody? Or is that too far?
I could be in, but only if it is nearby. 
#gif marathon.
So not philly.
I'll look for a good one and report, but I just wanted to gauge interest.
I could be down if its nearby.
I always do the Philly Rock-n-Roll half which is October 31st this year...which means I can't dress like an idiot and drink a lot of alcohol so, maybe not that one this year.

Anyone wanna sign up for a half marathon with me for the fall? It's around the time to sign up.

sUN, does this magical land exist #?
Looks like we need to consult the sUN god.
So you're agnostic about this magic land.
I'm not saying it's a lie; I'm saying I have no evidence to show it's true.
If you tell me that Donald duck in math magic land was a lie then my entire tower hill education was bullshit. Pretty sure I watched that movie like half a dozen times while I was there.
1) no, but I need coffee before I study them
2) sensationalized, yes. especially the grace at which they moved on land. but other than that, most morphological aspects were accurate.
3) as far as I know, ducks are poor mathematicians. I cannot comment on any special land they may or may not have access to.
4) never heard of it.
ok I'll answer these in order.
Do they like quackery coffee.
Furthermore, are ducks especially good at math and do they have access to a special land combing that skill with magic?
Matt as an expert was DuckTales generally accurate or was its portrayal of ducks sensationalized for TV?
Do the ducks need coffee before you can study them?

Not getting crunk.
The baha men song is about ugly girla.
I think his anthem was "Party and Bullshit".
'Who let the dogs out' by the Baha Men .
I hope Jesus turned on the song 'let's get it started in here' after he turned the wine.
"Symbolism" - whispered first word as you bring out the water bottle .
Or just brought wine in a water bottle. Very symbolic.
You guys should've pre-gamed it. 
Mandatory for our wedding.
Learning how to be married. Super lame and common sense. I'm pretty confident Erika and I are going pretty strong without a PowerPoint presentation explaining.
Johns Gospel is the only one that has Jesus doing any divine shit. Like the water to wine stuff you talked about is only in Johns gospel. 
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John bless this court that we play on. <- how I remembered the gospels, from church league basketball.

Sodom and Gomorrah is hella funny. Angels show up and are like, "yo, Lot, this town is hella sinful. Y'all better shape up." Then dudes from Sodom come to the house and are like "yo lot I hear you got some fine angel booty in there you're keeping to yourself. Let us in so we can rape their butts." And lot goes, "dudes totes not cool. What if I just give you my two daughters so you can rape them?" And the dudes are like, "naw we want angel booty".
Yeah that's the story alright.

I read it. Good stuff. But seriously, inside out..everyone go watch it.
Top 3 pixar movies: 

Bugs Life
Finding Nemo
Inside Out.
Have any of you ever read the Pixar multiverse theory? My favorite Pixar thing.
Roller coaster of emotion. 
It would be hard for me to do a Pixar top 3.
Seriously loved it.
Yea.
It was phenomenal.
I think that's in Pixar's top 3.
Pixar reaffirming their dominance.
Profound. Inspiring. Brilliant. Original. 
#gif loud and proud.
Dude. I might've. 
I fought tears the last 10ish minutes .
Did you cry?
The movie was amazing. 
Just watched Inside Out.

I was thinking of the one starring rex but that works too.

can you argue that my penis is big and nicely shaped?
I hate you, but goddamnit do I respect you.
Finally the trial of Bones v. Bread can have its day in court.
Andy you're going to professionally argue things in a year or two. None of us are going to stand a chance. All we have is to call you a nerd and drink more.
#sunstrike.
He said, responding to the earlier written remark.
But reading is for nerds?
Its an historic case. And scalia's opinion is like 5. For kennedy's opinion though, the substantive legal arguments start at section III. Everything before that is just giving the factual background of the case and the historical background of marriage law.

100 pages?
Refer to earlier comment about your douchenozzelry.
I heard his arguments were quality there.
Ok now do the ACA decision.
It only works because people listen to it, but its not like it has a military.
No. Just that it was exceeding its powers here, and that it has no real enforcement mechanism.
Wait did scalia argue "the supreme court is bullshit"?
Read it yourself douchenozzle.
Damnit I meant scalia on the ACA.
Im also pretty sure the states and federal government aren't about to pull an andrew jackson, so that seems like a silly thing to bring up.
Kennedy does a good job responding to the anti-democratic argument I think, and the originalism argument is simplistic imho.
Thats basically the gist.
-the court system depends on the other branches of governments and the states to carry out its orders. If we keep this shit up, they're eventually gonna tell us to fuck off.
-you cocky sons-of-bitches arent even trying to interpret law anymore.
-by having 9 unelected lawyers decide this case you are undermining american democracy.
-the question should have been "did the people who wrote the 14th amendment intend for it to legalize gay marriage? No? Ez case".
I'm not sure I can do justice to the words of a man considered to be one of the best writers in the history of the supreme court in a few blurbs, but I can summarize his arguments:.
I heard it was entertaining. Can you cliff notes the funny parts andy?
For anyone interested in this sort of thing, scalia's dissenting opinion is entertaining. Also the final word in it is "impotence" which is pretty funny.
Fuck yeah dude. Come down to dc. The wine and cheese thing will be celebratory .
just because we can.
wanna get married andy?
sUN knew the whole time.
Speaking of gender politics gay marriage is legal, in case anyone hadnt heard yet.
"In terms of its gender politics, Human Centipede is more sensitive".

And I could have been talking about easily a half dozen other events in my life Andy.
Woody is purely in the latter camp.
Is funny > good #?
I too well understand the tradeoffs of wanting good things for your friends but also wanting funny things to happen.
So suck it nerd.
But its entertaining for me.
I know putting pressure on you only makes it less likely to happen.
This weekend, redemption is spelled M I K E.
One time I was ship supposed to talk to this girl but then I didn't and nothing happened.
After that you're just pushing rope.
Dragon firm only lasts for 60 seconds.
Not quick enough for a sleepy dragon.
Quick cast time either way though.
Not in dragon form though.
Range on dragon tail is really short.
Dragos lets try to tone it down. We all dont live as crazy a life as you.
true story.
one time i was really horny so when i got back after a long day in the lab i started spanking the dragon tail but i fell asleep doing it cause i was too tired.
O God.
Stu changed the group's avatar.
From that fateful night.
Because if it did i am impressed.
4real.
Did that actually happen or is that something funny you wish happened?
It honstly sounds terrivle.
My ex and I went as team rocket for Halloween one year and we banged that night and as I finished I shouted "Team Rocket is blasting off agaaaaaaain!".
And then rotate who's on top throughout.
Butt?
And while fucking you have to start at the top and finish at the bottom.
Doing it on the stairs should be called the slinky.
Peppy Hare changed name to mikey d.
It sounded like a threesome with you Erika and a slinky .
I know but the mattress noises carries the farthest .
Stu I am not robotic! Very dynamic moves.
Heard that. 0/10.
You know who was the worst to hear fucking? Emy and goodyear. High pitched yelping and the occasional grunt.
Mostly spring noise so more robotic than anything .
Woot. Was it hot?
10/10 better than a lullaby.
Also I've heard woody have sex.
Facebook stock is $$$ right now I am very close friends with the chief engineer of their timeline and they have big moves coming up.
Fresh pants. So nice.
I just got back to civilisation off a seabird island.

critics called it, "underwhelming".
It was called "Make Your Move".
Dont leave me hanging.
How do it end?
Guys it ended. Don't worry I'll stop.
Wait there's an angry Irishman? I dunno his role yet.
Oh man and a rich talent scout is there!
The club is open for one last night. Time to leave it all on the line.
Also pretty sure woody is just watching some asian version of footloose.
I feel like my heart is in the right place I'm just forgetful and disorganized.
If your making a list, the temptation to put myself first was high, but then I realized that temptation meant I deserved to be lower :(.
I can live with being right behind Stu 😉.
Also, bad ass tap boy is in jail so the Asian is dancing her heart out in an empty warehouse.
💩.
I think thats a fair assessment.
I RESENT THAT.
I'd rank it Stu, mike, Jon, me, Andy,, Matt, dragos, Brian.
Andy your estimation of trust is not wrong.
Classic.
Ah the yakuza runs the club they tap at.
She could never love a dirty tap dancer.
okay, getting more enticing.
Omg the Asian girl is a yakuza leaders daughter! 
all i have is HBO GO, and also no.
Jon doesn't. Jonnnn.
not me. i'm literally watching the groupme on my computer.
We have work woody.
Someone else put on HBO .
No. No no tap fight.
Tap fight!?!?
I think mike. I've had to rely on him before. Also he would not say me because I locked him out of my place last time he was here.
Woah roommate fight.
It's the morning they making pancakes. Twist black roommate. Very racially diverse dance crew.
I think i'd pick...Stu.
who here would be the trustiest trust fall partner.
Feels like it was a reference to something earlier.
He caught her.
Risky trust fall happened.
This is HBO, I hope this gets naked.
It was porn the whole time.
Woah shirts off.
They did a little romantic tap robot dance, very impressive.
Romantic tapping now.
Oh no! The love interest is going back to Japan!
nice backpack, nerd!
not your woody though, just woody.
so we can see woody.
of yourself.
also send a picture.
i want to feel like im there.
woody please live comment this movie for us.
lol.
Hahah they just made a tap water joke. In the tap dance.
4andy.breathingheavy.
The party in Long Island had a chick I hooked up with at firefly, and two more that I wanted to see naked.
Like 2 hours. For friendship and alcohol? Thats nothing.
but I will simply consider it still. DC is still quite the drive.
Im intrigued woody.
:breathingheavier_andy:.
Was there ever an extreme tap dancing movie? I think I'm watching one.
:andnotjustbreatheheavy:.
Jon if I do, will you promise to come?
can i have "space cowboy".
Do it.
that'd be nyce.
I prefer Admiral of Love.
You know who I should invite? The nyce girl, she lives in DC.
come down from your ivory commitment pedestal.
woody you're getting married, you're like captain commitment.
Even Mike planned ahead. Mr no plan.
Way to commit.
I will consider DC. 
If you're only gonna bang one girl forever, gotta have a few good stories or you'll get left behind.
jesus.
have i met you.
is this even the woody i know.
And we did it downstairs, no door or room. Just in the open.
Parents were home.
wow that is the most dangerous game.
You guys are moving too fast I can't keep up.
Most dangerous sex place? Erika's parents house. 
so... cool your tits jon.
im pretty sure my prof pic is me when im like 10.
They are all undergrads.
A friend of mine has his birthday on the same day, so he's bringing his gf and some of her friends.
this "mike desrosiers" is a looker.
jon you almost imposingly wise.
brb gonna creep on the chicks going on the event on facebook.
andy's last two statements are also applicable if jon had said, "i've never gotten a girl pregnant".
Because if you come it will never be true again.
Enjoy that statement jon.
don't enjoy it enough to drink enough of it to get hammered.
(if history is any guide).
I don't think i've ever gotten drunk from wine.
then eventually someone shows up with whiskey.
If that gives you some indication.
there are snacks provided, and there is no beer available.
this pleases me.
and it wasnt the guy i was aiming for either.
LOL.
Super duper .
probably the sloppiest event ever.
I punched a guy last time.
jon: too drunk.
Very.
How drunk do you think we'll get at this wine and cheese thing.
Alright, sneakiest place people have had sex?
Does woody have stealthy sex#?
Revealing your phobias is just the worst idea ever. I'm not kind.
You're*.
But if you have, your welcome.
Silent strike.
I don't think anyone hears me banging.
I have heard Andy banging.
Look if bros cant deal with hearing other bros doing the broest thing possible then I don't know what being a bro is.
I am not going to DC.
Liz didnt realize that mike could hear what was going on until I made a comment about hearing her with joel.
i've had enough of this.
So...good for you.
Well apparently you were doing a good job.
gross.
100% sure mike has.
How does that make you feel?
99% sure ive heard Andy have sex.
Im touching my nipples right now jon.
Jon has the weirdest phobia thinking about me doing anything naked or sexual.
Unless he was banging you.
so that he'd stop and deal with my poop.
or also poop.
either that or puke.
I'm pretty sure if I heard andy banging someone in the same room as me, i'd consider seppuku.
You're not wrong.
And mike the easiest way to solve that problem is GO HOME WITH THAT GIRL.
Im gonna have liz bring the air matress so there will be space.
LOL.
 I do not want to hear Andy bang someone so unsure where I'll stay.
Who needs Woody when you have cheese.
hm. well. mike are you staying with andy in DC?
Cheese will be there.
woody, is woody going.
I'm in New York, you coulda hung with me.
Wine will be there.
mike are you going.
Mike will be there.
DO IT.
yeah then theres that.
DO IT.
Accept the invitation to the wine and cheese thing.
Was thinking of going to my beach house but all my friends are at the shore this weekend.
Then I thought about going to a Nelly concert in Hersey, PA but then I thought fuck Nelly.
Jon one sec.
I was gonna drive to Long Island, NY to go to a house party but then I decided that was too far of a drive.
I'm eating a street taco. 7/10.
Jon quick, make plans.
taste a lady?
I've got zero plans this weekend.
bold flavors from a bold woman; .
FUCKIN BONED!
#sunstrike.
OOOO.
I wouldnt describe your mom as tangy dragos.
OMG.
andy have you not tasted a woman???
Cant he we just have fun?
Shutup jon.
thot actually means, "that hoe over there".
What does tangy mean with reference to a person?
tangy hoe often topless.
Both good.
Totally horny old tigers.
Tranny hooker offering testers.
Wtf is a thot?
Which also explains her rebellious phase where she sasses me every chance she gets.

A response now would also be nice.
Respond when convenient.
So dragos, when you did this, were you basing the drawing off of some other specific artist or a certain style of art, or is this just what things look like in your head?
more like "awe tits!".
reeling that one back in.
too far? too far.
andy this is why dragos is the artist and you're the autist.
Bring it full circle.
That hat should've had nipples.
But slightly more.
Well not really.
Does it #?
That makes way more sense.
Oh they're wings! I thought they were little mustaches.
He really only skipped the eyes.
faces are hard to draw. i appreciate the meta punting on that.
Wings for nipples? That I can't follow. Art is hard.
very edgy.
Instead of drawing a face, he wrote "FACE".
Can we talk more about the Dragos drawing?
from the things i've learned from woody and apps, i can now determine you are a middle aged mother because you are playing phone games still.
Also speaking of mobile things, Anyone who has an iphone should play this fallout shelter game. Hella fun and addicting.
Alright I'm sold. Now if only I had some money...
>will start to figure out.
business!
Mobile ads are incredibly ineffective so they are also very cheap (pennies for tons of views). People will start to figure out  how to deliver successful mobile ads soon, and when they do Facebook is positioned to profit, they have the data.
Not bad. Are mobile ads effective at all? Or more to the point, do mobile companies feel like those ads are effective?
hahabusiness dot jpeg.
Mobile ads constitute 2/3 of facebooks ad revenue, higher % than Google. I think mobile ads are grossly underserved in spending, so I think their revenue is bound to go up more than expected.
Can we sub in the perfectly looped version of that gif?
#sunstrike.
But it seems like I dont need to.
I was gonna go there if you had a good response.
I'm getting ahead of expected points.
This is basic finance.
this isnt that.
Don't go spouting your "a walk down wall street" shit up in here.
What is your argument that this fact isnt already incorporated into the current price?
you're taking advice from a Zynga guy? thats like taking moral advice from a business-savvy Lucifer.
Saying that a business is good, is different than saying that their stock is currently undervalued.
Talking to Zynga guy. Says they pay millions in advertising to put their games at the top of the store. Facebook is the only network which works, they spend almost everything there. Feels like a good endorsement.
he's not called Steel-y for a reason.
Woody, always ahead of the times.

I just decided we should all buy Facebook stock.

The chicken salad is good. The chicken isn't as chunky as I remember in the biderman George but still great. 
This feels more graphic than sexting.
There's also Cole slaw in here that's also great .
pepper = good crunch.
talk to me about the chicken salad.
well played.
Crispy bacon, chicken salad, toasted bread .
Woody, this sandwich is exactly like the grilled George at biderman .
The most disappointing thing is that I'm getting subway for lunch, so its not even going to be a very good sandwhich.

I like peppers with yogurt though, so that seems like a good combo.

How well does lamb work with peppers.
I'm thinking on the skewer.. lamb, onions, red and green peppers. Should I make anything else to accompany it.

O man or maybe Asian lamb.
I could go and go on this.
I'll stop talking now.
Drench in mint pesto, cumin, salt and hit hard on grill. Add some red pepper to pesto to make it a bit spicy so it goes with the yogurt.
I'd do like a Mint Pesto for the lamb, Yogurt sauce cause Dragos is right then cook some banging veggies on the grill too.
Ground lamb or lamb chunks?
or maybe just add it on top.
ditch one of the sauces (peas or yogurt) and sub in some crisp vegtables (onions?).
Pea Puree? Opposed. You've got lamb (tender), Yogurt Sauce (very soft) and now pureed peas (also soft). No texture variety.
Yeah i was waiting for woody to chime in.
woah we talking food?
I assume it involves pureeing peas. Then again I'm no chef.
Dragos what is pea pureee .
I'll pass by a good butcher later today and see if they have good lamb. 
lamb  kabobs with yogurt sauce and pea pureee.
I think I'm gonna make some Kabobs tonight on the grill. Any experts in the group have any pro moves?
#gif cleavage.
pretty crappy life.
I'm about that life.
Not about that life.

I'm taking a poop right now. Now are you entertained woody? Is this exciting enough.
It would placate me. Little lobby drama? Sounds tasty. 
Im just saying, thats a pretty good way to placate an asshole hotel guest.
I like Andy being dubious.
If its public it could be just for show. Ask the guy to rip up her time card for you.
Ask her if she can clean up one more room then gesture at your penis.
its mega awkward.
Also, some hotel employee is getting fired right next to me.
I get it.
You guys moved on I guess.

well you gotta brainstorm to get to the best answer, and im glad to see that andy's solved transportation forever.
do you eve GTA3?
fire the tank backwards and fly there like a man.
enter the cheat for low gravity and then get yourself a tank.
nah dude helicopters are for pussies.
i think this is the exact situation for which rich people own helicopters. easy solution: use the GTA cheat codes to get a helicopter.

Sounds cool. I feel like the good setting was key.
the music was very accessible. just a great experience overall. i'm glad i tried it once.

Wasn't like anything i've ever tried (just shrooms once and weed). Kind of eye opening when it started to hit, felt very relaxed and loose, super willing to be friendly and get to know the people at my camp site even more.
Seemed like things were safe and entertaining, so I tried it that same night during Kygo.
I was very cautious. I watched one of my friends who also never tried it before try it before me so I could watch as things unfold before I went in.

I'd give that a 10, cam.

>slaying pussy on the beach.
She cheated, we were young and "in love" I am a much wiser person now. Probably won't marry until I have full adult financial stability and when I get tired of slaying pussy on the beach.
Promise ring. I demand more info. Tell all Cam. Why did you break up?
Dated a girl for 3 years, bought a promise ring. Close enough.
Can it's like you've been engaged before.
If she takes her clothes off you're in... If she opens a book, takes off her glasses, sets her alarm, asks if you took out the trash, comments on your weight, or starts snoring like she is asleep even though you know she isn't an audible sleeper... You're out.
Once you're getting married you just holler "woman get in this bed". Same idea.
Woody this isn't theory this is a truth, trust me. I love watching females walk by the tower. I count how many times they fix their hair. If they do It more than twice walking by the tower, I call them over.
Foolproof way to test in or out ness.
If she adjusts her shirt, you're out.
Theory. If you get caught looking at a girl cheat and she plays with her hair, you're in.
Jon one of your snapchats had "Tatnall lacrosse" shorts in them. Fuck that guy. 
Yea it's awesome.

Are they stronger than nukes?
Because it seems like they'd need to be pretty intense for them to defeat modern day people.
What are his powers?

So they just kill humans?
the bird is the love interest ; a former mortal enemy of the crab falls in love with the tiny hero .

In a meeting I don't want to be in...

I hope you've learned your lesson.
Kevin added matthew engl to the group.
Woody Zantzinger is going to 'learn more than the first verse of "You've Lost That Lovin Feeling"'.
100%. I've done two things total today.
i feel like its pretty easy to tell when i have an assignment at my job going on based on my groupme activity.
LOL.
Kevin removed Matthew from the group.
watch the movie and then you can come back.
matt get the fuck off this groupme.
i've never seen it.
hint: its easier if you're getting laid.
Fuck I love top gun.
also how easy it is to get over the death of a best friend.
very true.
But mostly what to do if she loses that loving feeling.
or how heterosexual shirtless beach vollyball can be.
like how snapping ones teeth can intimidate our rivals.
top gun teaches us many things.
That's what top gun teaches us.
if i havent won a girl over by  the first verse then its probably not happening.
Andy Esposito is not going to 'learn more than the first verse of "You've Lost That Lovin Feeling"'.
Matthew is not going to 'learn more than the first verse of "You've Lost That Lovin Feeling"'.
Kevin is going to 'learn more than the first verse of "You've Lost That Lovin Feeling"'.

all i'm saying is, if she didnt want us to sing, she shouldn't have lost that loving feeling.
Matthew is not going to 'come to grips with the notion that sexuality is a spectrum'.
"belt".
using the term sing loosely of course.
but i did sing a love song with you later in the night.
Andy you wouldn't even hold hands with me in Dupont circle.

no im not.
matt's a card.
How much to pour was a big factor.
I was going to say Matt's favorite card game was duck duck goose, then I remembered that didn't involve cards. 
Bull fucking shit.
to be fair, we played arrogance a lot, and there was zero skill in that game.
You imbecile.
No they aren't Andy.
Um, are coins cards?
If war is a card game then so is flipping a coin.
You dont even make choices.
Woody's favorite card game is kings. 
That game is bullshit.
is your favorite card game 'war'?
If your opponent knows what he's doing, not lose is the best you can ever do.

Would not recommend though.
There was a "motion for this court to kiss my ass".
"motion to party, your honor".
can you use the phrase "bring it arounnnnnnnnnnd town" in a motion.
sympatric is a great word.
I would send a pic of the 2255 motion I'm reviewing but I bet thats against the law or something.

And possibly going to get mers.

Andy the correct answer was "you're half a magnet".
>FTFY.
If it weren't for you meddling people procrastinating at work.
And I would have gotten away with it too if it werent for you meddling people in your mid-20s.
Caught you, Andy!

What the fuck is a clock?
if it's one thing science can't explain, it's that.
Cant explain that science.

It was trying to search through everyone's previous games before finishing booting. Heroku was shutting it down for taking >60 seconds to boot, although it was just spending time parsing games. I moved the auto update function further down in the boot order, but this is a temp fix.
No, more investigation says it wasn't.

Dota 2 reborn top of r/all right now! What is this?!?!
The Gabriel Gull indiginious to upstate Maryland.
The raptor.
Probably an ostrich just cause its the biggest bird in the world.
Trick question .
Which bird has the girthiest gullet @Matthew .
Pit is included, hope your gullet is girthy.
We were like 14 tops. And that was a slaughter.
Avocados fucking rule.
Pit or no pit cam? I hear Jon is into pits now.
Why it would be a nice event.
Lol Canadians can't eat. 
Cam I would fucking ruin you in an avocado eating contest.
Damn. 
I'll go head to head with anyone in an avocado eating contest.
First one we were like 16. Just boys then. 
Sex, pies, or both Woody?
Like pie like with women.
Whoa. No no. I murdered your ass at the last pie eating contest. I watched a video.
Jon used tools, I just dive in.
Story adds up.
And he got rocked.
yes.
Did you smoke woody at eating pie #?
Apple.
Woah Jon you drink?
I was pretty drunk.
Remember that time I smoked you at eating that pie? Cause I don't.
What kind of pie?
Yes.
Guys have beers on the train. Is that legal? That seems awesome. 
Moke chat.
Some do. 
I didn't think Kabuki theaters had projectors. 
Cause they're on a bus.
Why.
Yes.
Do people still play mobile games.
Jon. You wanna bring the noise in a pie eating contest again? 2 for 2.
Woody what could you possibly be doing on that bus other than group chat.
That'd be OK.
I wanna be in mikes chat .
This is the Mike chat now. 
"Just like the Egyptian economy, right fellows?".
I hope I'm like this when I'm rich and sixty and the burns are all super erudite.
Burning people is such fun.
Omg so ez.
Idk I hear Matt's pretty good at eating dick.
If there ever comes a day where I can challenge matt to an eating contest, you best believe I'll bring the noise. 
This metro train is full of dudes going into DC to go out.
http://i.imgur.com/nACY6nb.gif.
They only have split infinitives #sunstrike.
Hey Matt have you ever had a cheeseburger? Do they have those in Canada?
Little column a, little column b.
A big nerd.
Or just a nerd.
I'm wearing glasses that don't have real lenses in them. I feel like a fraud. A sexy fraud.
>Well played!
>Affirmative.
I assume it's a good time though!
Don't you like that Matt, you don't even know.
1:51 Charlottesville to Vienna metro. Ez mid.
Good use of cromulent.
So shallow and pedantic .
> Affirmative .
... That's cromulent.
JON YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THE CHATWHEEL SINCE YOU UNINSTALLED DOTO.
> Relax, you're doing fine.
>Oops!
I can't believe that didn't make sense to me. Im so used to adding "at" to the end of any sentence that involves direction. Big oops from me.
No I meant the N word. I'm pretty sure they don't have that in Canada.
Did you mean Microsoft word. 
Word. One word.
Apparently they don't have word in Canada.
Fucking Canada. 
What's wrong with that.
>what hell.
>Places you would not stop.
Unless you decided to drive through Springfield, we will not pass. I'm on a world tour of "Places you would not stop". We're stopping at them all.
Check.Mate.
Yeah but where's your snacks .
Woody I'm probably going to pass you. Loll buses suck.
Jesus Dragos.
WHAT DID I MISS.
important update clarification : is wizard staff euphemism for stellar hard penis?
Mike trips over a wire in his apartment, that wire pulls down a wrench in mike's kitchen, that wrench knocks over a glass of water, the water trickles down underneath his bathroom door, andy trips on the water in the bathroom while he's taking a piss and knocks down the door with his butt out. *cuts to bold letters of Final Destination of Ass*.
It was great.
Someone chased after him.
Hammered.
Someone ran by he bus with a pretty solid wizard staff.
Stopped in Sprinfield?

All aboard the butthole bus. Dragos is the conductor.
A bus to butthole road would take you no time at all. But I don't have to tell you that matt, I'm sure you've visited many times before.
Maybe a plane then.
A bus from where I live to dela-nowhere would be like 48hrs.
Bring snacks though.
Flights? Take a bus.
I haven't been to a festival in two years now. I'm getting serious jitters.
Also I'm playing a show next weekend so I'm booked.
I was looking at flights and theyre just too expensive for me.
Just got my firefly ticket in the mail. It's not too late matt. Break your chains of canada that have weighed you down your whole life.
Sorry woody, you'd better keep looking.
The guy in front me is eating fried chicken, whole bus smells great.
no.
Are these his people #?
Maybe these are my people.
It's been great.
Beyond the way too low cut woman who got off.
I'm gonna be honest.
Woody where all the bus updates at?
Hearting*.

You could pay people to move stuff in for you .
Nobody is in town this weekend so doto?
It seems like a tight squeeze, but if you just relax and have some patience you can fit it all in.
Did everything for through the backdoor ? I know they are typically smaller.

Use me as a coatrack.

Actually, in my will I want my body to be used in pranks for like a week after I die.
Hookers and blow is a pretty good answer to a riddle.
I'm just gonna will piles of salt to all my family and friends.
The riddle in my will is gonna be "where did all of his money go" when nobody gets shit.
Also totally gonna include a riddle in my will.
Also I feel like these kind of riddles would be better if they arent discovered until the creator of the riddle is dead or if he's unknown. The fact that there's just some guy there who knows the answer takes away from it somehow.

also, it looks like the guy in woody's gif took a picture that was a little.... washed out.
just fart on their lunches when they're not looking .
negatives: not the biggest fan of my coworkers.
positives: machinist was able to cut down the shaft of a gearbox by 1/4" and not damage it. used an angle grinder to shorten some screws and that worked. good sandwich for lunch. got a quote from another vendor for 30% less than the first vendor wanted.
What can Andy do to make it slightly better .
Medium day.
Mike! Nice!
Kevin.

Yeah but we're cool. 
If you change that sentence slightly it makes our group sound super depressing: "...so i can tell you what vagina is like".
I honestly hope I score so I can tell you guys what the vagina was like. Also because girls. 
Girls got bush.
Because its a jungle.
Or in the case of jons girl, catching malaria in the pussy.

"You like pictures? How about picturing us on a date?".
Also firefly is next weekend. Prepare for me to Hiroshima this GroupMe during that time. 
Next time I see her is Tuesday. Also I have no idea how I'm gonna do it. "Whatcha got there, phone numbers?".
Jon get her number or I'll call you mean names for 2 hours.
You wont.
All up in them pits.
Jon, stop wondering what things look like and get in there.
That was a rollercoaster of emotions.
It was actually in my photo class. I was talking to her essentially for the first time, then she adjusted her hair real nice like when we were talking, things were on the up and up, then suddenly I noticed her armpit; part of me thinks I was staring at it for a little. Flustered I quickly went back to what I was doing. 
I wish today had been "lines from the Eminem song 'lose yourself'" day.
Long hair don't care Jon.
Its probably a jungle jon.
Is she French? The french love their hair.
Jon I'm imagining you stumbling around the gym in a dazed panic, your world crashing down.
Is that a European thing? I wonder what her vagina looks like .
Maybe she's european or something.
I don't even understand. She's like super well groomed and stuff, then suddenly super hairy armpit. Its like when I found out Santa wasn't real. 
It was like seeing a black astronaut get shot .
It was like seeing a unicorn get murdered. 
Big update with the girl with the big butt: she doesn't shave her armpits. I was alarmed today.

Not entirely sure how you'd accomplish it though without the group drafting for you.
A tinder competition would be pretty funny.
Your bills must be pretty cheap then.
I'd be a 10/10. These curves pay the bills.
Would make the rating system slightly less arbitrary.
Math.
What if the numbers corresponded to percentage of yes swipes if you made a tinder profile. Like a 9 would be 90% yes swipes.
ez 1.8.
I've got to be a 1.5.

> Good game, well played.
probably can't solve the fact that matt is ugly. no amount of sorrys can solve that.
Literally nothing.
what can't be solved with several sorrys in canada?
All in all a good day.
Several sorrys later, we were back to fishing.
Read about that. Crazy stuff. I was once on the border of US and Canada by Washington state fishing with my dad and uncle and two armed border guards came up to us because they were chasing three Mexicans that hopped the border and thought from afar we were them.
only 25 miles from canada.
also matt, be careful: http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/08/us/new-york-prison-break/index.html.
1st rule: no touching of the hair or face...and thats it!
No teams. Royal rumble. 
do you think elimination chandilier could be a thing? like after 3 times getting slapped you're out?
scrap that idea, and new idea will be thought of.
yea.
idk, either way it wont work like i planned.
yeah, they'd all keep pointing at the same people, right?
this is stupid.
no wait.
turn inner cirlce twice, outer cirlce once.
no wait a single line inside.
I was thinking a board up on the wall with all 7 faces on it in a circle. Inside the outer circle is another circle with all 7 faces which can rotate. Inside that circle is ANOTHER rotating circle with varied lines, two from each inner face to 2 random other faces.
i wish i realized that 20 minutes ago.
it requires each person to play 6 other games, and there's 4 people in each game: so (6*7)/4 is how many games. 42 is not divisible by 4 so this will not actually work.
I'm making it up in my head.
not familar.
...
I think a dual wheel turning doo hickey would get this done.
not sure if possible.
current challenge: create a 7 man doubles round robin beer pong tournoment in which each person plays with each other person once, and against every other person twice.

Also a point in the honor social policy helps you fight barbarians better.

But animal husbandry! For the lonely people.
I research archery early because archers deal well with barbarians.

Mike exists. I saw it.
I died.
Fooka yoo dorphin!

And I still have no confirmation that Mike exists so I can't comment on the diet of his civilization.
The Chinese do whatever it takes, dogs, cats. Well eat whatever. 
And the fucking Japanese STILL harvest 1000s of Minke whales per year for "research" purposes which is total bullshit.
But, us French people force-feed geese until they're too fat to walk, and then slaughter them for foie gras, so we're not much better.
I'm pretty sure the chinese eat cats.

Well that village has been fucking up your units.

Yeah, the game starts out very primitive though. You start with nothing and are essentially a stupid idiot..so learning to craft a gun is much later in the game.
Jon that sounds dank.
Yea.
Still sort of a lateral maneuver.

I never played it but that gears of war mad world one was pretty sweet.
Best movie or video game trailer. Go.
also I watched the Fallout trailer. Jon rating: eh.

jon played so much dota he could even check his mail.

#kobe, what is Jon's IQ is because he's a fan of Rakishi?
Before any match he has, I'd casually slip in him eating some stinky food while other things are going on during the other matches. "ooo he had chipotle todayyy" - fans.
*hwhat.
That's a large booty I tell you what.
Stinky Face was the move name I thino.
I remember him well.
I'd say he was my favorite. 
There was a fat wrestler named Rakishi who's move was to put his huge ass on a fallen opponents face.
"EZIEST MATCH OF MY LIFE".
See, I'm already into the WWE trash talking from all the dota I've played. 
I bet Jon's favourite WWE wrestler is gold dust.
I'll arm bar the shit out of you.
Better than yours. 
How good is your wrestling game?
 I think the trick is winning a wwe championship.
Its perfect for almost any moment in your life.
No. But I want one. 
...do you have such a belt?
I missed an golden opportunity during my graduation to hold up a WWE champion belt as I walked across. Fuck.

True. Probably coulda taken the meepo who was level 25 about 10 minutes in (obvious exaggeration is obvious).
But you wouldn't have been so weak with the third.
They just ended it and there was nothing my weak shadow shaman could do.
We had just double raxed them after jon bought back, but then we hung around too long and ds got picked off and then jon got picked off, and neither had bb.
Actually i was the only one alive at the end of that one.

I might get fallout 3 later this summer after i get bored with civ.
I liked Skyrim actually, but you're right the storylines weren't the greatest. I don't really know what I didn't like about fallout cause I didn't play it long enough to remember since I didn't like it, a hilarious cycle.
I will simply nuke that empire, like I have done in the past.
Andy, nice Ozymandias-grade banter.
But yeah, should be fun.
I will create an empire so mighty that the gods will weep at its splendor. 
Is anyone joining Matt, Andy and me on Thursday for the war of the worlds?
I like the idea of a really open world, unlike jon. Skyrim was fun, but honestly most of the storylines were super shallow. Red dead redemption had less breadth but much more depth and is probably the best story in any game I've ever played .
ive only read the first and i thought it pretty good.
I've been meaning to read them.
One of my best friends loooves the dune books.
damnit i still havent gotten you dune yet, woofty.
#sunburn.
Books are for nerds.
Am I right?
If you want story, read a book.
But then again, if you want story, play Final Fantasy 7. Or chrono trigger.
Bioshocks storylines are nuts.
If you're looking for story, BioShock infinite.
It's a super cool world.
The games story is like 10/10.
I don't get you, Matt. You're an enigma. 
I don't get it.
Sounds like you had a falling out.
Wasn't a fan of the fallout series. The scale of the game and task oriented gameplays don't really interest me.
The fallout website is a 24 hour countdown. Fallout 4 rumors abound.
Is there a new one coming out? Thats a game i always wanted to try.

alright mike, we're not trying to create a batman villan.

also, blind date night. you show up and get paired at a table with a random number of people.
i could fuck with that.
what if a sweet machine made you cocktails.
so we should diversify.
they have conveyor belt sushi.
are you suggesting conveyor belts?

That Mariah Carey gif was not the worst. It was nice. 
She took like 5 minutes then understood it was meant to be funny but was pretty pissy until she figured that out :sheep:.
Even if you do understand it, its still really funny. Plus philosophy is a big fucking subject, so there's always gonna be some stuff you havent encountered yet.
I sent it to my sister and she was moderately offended that I didn't think she understood the subject matter.
He makes complex subjects easy to understand in a really funny way.
All of his posts are fantastic though and I know I've posted this on here before, but if you are ever curious about any subject relating to philosophy check to see if he's posted on it.
I want going to read the post because I thought he'd answered it seriously, but then I read like the last 3 lines and got super confused. Get fucking rekt kid.
>While Utilitarianism is about a thing, the social contract is primarily about a different thing.
A post from my favorite blog, I'm dying laughing: http://www.philosophybro.com/post/104700123978/hey-bro-i-was-wondering-if-you-could-give-me-some.
Is that what did it for you?
If anyone was curious of the nerd level of the group, we have now established that mike has a favorite unit of measurement and stu has a favorite metric prefix.
are there 10 decals on your car.
Deca- is my favorite prefix .
"Deca-tryhardons".
eh.
Also I thought of an effort unit: tryhardons.
IF YOU REQUEST A GIF NOW, YOU'LL GET A SECOND GIF FREE!!!!
FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY.
DID WE JUST GO INTO BILLY MAYS MODE????
"I want to be metric-y, but I don't want to use metric"--- THEN DO I HAVE A SOLUTION FOR YOU.
my favorite unit is either the kip (kilopound, 1000 pounds), or the ksi (kilo-psi, kilo pounds per square inch).
I cant think of a good effort unit.
metric, you know me bb.
Hilarity measured in kilochuckles.
= D_big.
Hilarity/effort.
69 amirite.
Ah the Desrosiers number.
You could always set it for specific typos. I cant think of any good ones though.
ive found things that you can set custom dictionaries and stuff for but the prep work to hilarity ratio is too low here.
I appreciate you considering it though .
Yeah it would have to check every word against a dictionary or something. And even then it would fuck up often because of dota terms, abbreviations and slang.
erf this would be too difficult to get to work right. it's not just about calling out one word, it's about a lot of things.
.............hang on a second.
Also in before "we".
Its too bad sun isnt slightly smarter. If we could program her to call out typos it would be hilarious.

it just has to happen, I was thinking today how much more I could get done in the fuckin 100 days that I played dota. I don't regret playing it cause the game gave me people like matt, dragos, cam and even brian. But for the at least for the time being, I need to really concentrate on what i'm doing.
i snapchatted that I was uninstalling to my sister and brother and even they were confused.
JON IM SORRY PLEASE DONT LET IT END THIS WAY.

That was a roller coaster of emotions .

i think battlefury is better than midas on alch. i like that build.
and a carry alch.
weaver sb lesh alch disruptor lvl 1 rosh lol.
alliance game lvl1 rosh.
and that was enough for 4asc to get back in the game, and it was pretty much over from there.
they had won all four lanes and then ended up losing a fight when they tried to push because viper didnt have the mek.
literally no damage.
if anyone wants to see how a midas buy can throw a game watch the 4asc v. bu game 2. viper gets a midas instead of a mek when they are way ahead. 4asc has now pulled ahead with a pl, magnus and weaver.

He had one nuke and spent it. No he has to fight a land war with a navy. 
Problem for you: nukes in the air.
Problem for him is, I aint no france.
Woody isnt north korea, he's more like germany or japan but with nukes.
If history has taught us anything, its that the Aztecs live forever.
I anyways went with the north Korea strategy too, woody.
Wait no false. The sun never sets on England. It sets hard on the Aztecs .
True.
Andy's world is cooler.
The civ game has boiled down to Andy has like 3 amazing cities filled with wonder and technology and I own the world with a series of slums and military might.

You didnt have an alch farm you an aghs though so only A- .
So basically wp!
Unless they have no magic damage at all, bkb is necesarry on that hero.
i even built bkb. that was a game of "welp guess i gotta buy these items".
Yeah, not really bad on any hero especially since the cd change. It probably ups your farmspeed too.
Move speed and push. Fairly standard core lesh. A lot like timber.
You need the bloodstone first for sure.
The travels are weird but yeah that seems like the right order.
In that order.

Its basically a hearts worth of regen during a teamfight.
Lol no.
You're overthinking this: it's for the tankiness and CD reduction. The hp regen is a slight bonus. Can we move on?
Boo.
FIGHT!!!
FIGHT.
I'm not going to be able to convince you but I don't agree.
Not game changing but still good i think.
In teamfights it could matter.
So basically 10 hp regen per second for each hero burned.
That's math alright.
So the formula would be 50*.75*.25*number of heroes burned.
Sun you dog.
never mind.
No, you unclefucker.
guys andy's gotta get skin cancer from all this #sunburn that you're giving him.
It wasn't even that much regen on a slotted lesh.
50 DMG Andy...it's not a lot of regen.
It's 50 dmg / sec Andy.

YOURE MINIMAL.
If you have radiance burn on like 2 or three heroes in a teamfight, that isnt minimal in the midgame.
By HP gain I meant steal from resistance.
calling octarine core ocarina: still not old.
100% uptime illusions with ocarina.
Tankiness.
Mostly mana and CD, the HP gain is minimal.
Probably solves any mana issues she has too.
Decreased song cd.
Decreased illusions cd.
Gain health from radiance.
no-tail and him do octarine on naga, whats the idea there.
Makes sense. Naga is really strong right now in pubs i think.
he's been playing leshrac and naga a bunch but thats it.
Has he been spamming in particular heroes?
just ripping through MMR.

I don't think I'm up for multiplayer civ.
Kevin is not going to 'Civ 5 - The Great War'.
Lack of feedback is hurting me here.
Im available for either.
What about tonight?
:(.
i can do weekdays just not this thursday.
I know they can be saved i just dont know if they can be resumed as a group.
Weekends don't work for me.
My hope is we can pick a repeatable weekday.
I'm 100% sure you can save multiplayer games.
Woody thinks we can. I'm not sure.
matches last so long.
can we save the state of the world?
Cant do fridays or saturdats, and it would be against each other, but with city-states.
can you save multiplayer games.
Andy Esposito is going to 'Civ 5 - The Great War'.
are we doing against comps or each other.
i can do saturday.
Trying this again. Who can do Thursday?
Matthew is going to 'Civ 5 - The Great War'.
Woody Zantzinger created event 'Civ 5 - The Great War' https://s.groupme.com/i1ei64es.
now we just have to fight all the distractions on our phones.
We had a to fight a war, not a court battle.
Something went wrong.
Yeah, that was declared constitutional .
#gif purple nurple.
So the real question is, would madison have okay'ed the purple nurple thing.
Thats how I justify my slaves.
You mean like slavery?
You dont need to even ethically justify it if you're an originalist, the argument is way easier: was this considered cruel and unusual by the founders? No? Then its ok.
ethical gymnastics to justify our baser tendencies .
You've actually got a pretty good chance considering the death penalty isnt considered cruel by a majority of the court .
we just need an expert psychiatrist to declare him a masochist .
So as long as it didnt qualify as cruel its constitutional.
Cruel and unusual punishment is not allowed, but cruel or unusual punishment might be allowed.
andy is that a legal possibility? 
when i look at the picture of the fifa president i just want to give him daily purple nurples as punishment .
This would be a fucking sweet case to work on, actually my dream job.
It must have taken weeks to go through all the info.
Imagine being on this grand jury.
And yeah this would have been a bitch to write.
Count 1 for example alleges racketeering in new york and elsewhere in the united states.
when i see that huge document i imagine lots intern tears of exhaustion that went into putting it together.
Very broad jurisdiction.
And any company that even operates within the us is required to follow the FCPA.
There is the indictment.
http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/450211/download.
?
were the money laundering operations through us companies.
We're the principals office for the world.
Also, cause we are the biggest and bestest?
They did these deals on us soil.
US crimes.
what i dont get is why they are being extradited to the us.
Also the stuff FIFA is doing is significantly more clear cut than anything Wall St. may be doing. They literally are accepting suitcases full of millions of dollars.
And the people who enforce wall street stuff are almost certainly different people.
i know it is.
And thats a pretty bullshit argument: other people are doing bad things so you shouldnt focus on these people.
You can read the indictment online, which is pretty cool. 163 pages, 41 counts.
apparently a lot of people are angry that the us is going after a mostly non american corruption scheme instead of cleaning up wall street .
soccer execs in general are such sleazeballs from club owners to  league execs .
true a lot are latino ;.
Also dragos, a lot of the people involved in the fifa thing arent white you racist.

Given that woodys family used to own a tobacco plantation (right?) It wouldnt surprise me if it turned out he was related.
But there is a Richard Zantzinger who patented a multiple-row tobacco harvesting machine.
not shocking.
Apparently no one with the last name Zantzinger has published any scientific literature.
I'm not, I was just doing some lit review and wondered if I could find any science published by people in this groupme.
Matt why are you googling everyone?
Haha no, just pointing out how uncommon his last name is.
Is that sciencey smack talk.
Dragos, this is the only paper that comes up when I searched your last name in the authors field of Web of Science.
no.
Waaaaaaaas it tho #yesorno.
yes.
Was it? #yesorno.
Like most of your statements woody, that was a lie.
FYI Paulina plays words and can wreck everyone.
I'm an open book. That's how I earn trust.
Woody giving away what letters he has to mike. Classic mistake.
Disagree.
It also is great when someone makes a really good word and then you just throw an s on the end of its.
"Hey you thought really hard about that word, didnt you?".
It also is great when someone makes a really good word and then you just throw an s on the end of it.
It sets up wombo combos.
Also if there were to be any letter that should be worth zero points in scrabble its s. 
*hands.
Woody I'm gonna have nukes while your people are still shitting in their hand.
Andy if you be bringing that trash tonight I'll be burning your sheep fields before the Renaissance .
I mean if you wanna play like that then i guess its okay.
Also Andy you're a noob.
It's free!
K reinstalling words.
You can play dike for a lot of points.
This is what he played.

No one is giving me a day to start this epic battle. Are we gonna strive for tonight?

The question is, which civ?
Without a doubt.
#magic8.
So civ battle is happening? 
Meh.
Oh.
Thats after, Civ 5 is still on earth.
Shit was so fun.
Did any of you guys play Sid Meyer's Alpha Centauri? It was a civ game on an alien planey.
Or is that the one after civ 5.
Civ 5 you are colonizing an alien planet.
I've only played civ 3 and 4, can't be that different though.
I selfishly Vote Civ 5 because I already have it.
Gonna start reading up on it at work.
Alright this is obviously happening.
Betraying allies is the most fun. Slowly amass an army on their border, cut trade ties over the course of a few decades. Watch them wither, then strike.
You can go to space???
This is the space one right?
I think the first rule in this game is no one trust woody.
Step 3) Cut the throats of your allies.
Also, if its anything like settlers, riding in on a wave of sheep is the key.
Step 2) Control Spice.
Dyes or die.
Step 1) Pick Arabic empire.
the Spice must flow.
I'm always the Spice lord.
Oil, copper, whales, cows, wheat, aluminium, uranium, rubber, salt, .
So thats a yes on cows?
Andy there are like 50 resources.
Also fuck small maps. I want this to be an epic story of empires rising, alliances turning sour, bitter feuds. Also i assume cows or something? I've never actually played this game.
false.
Woody, you're essentially about to replace dota with a videogame that is 1000X more addicting and has games that are 5X longer.
I sunk a scary amount of hours in to Civ3.
It sounds like a more complex version of settlers so I'm in.
Meh/10.
http://i.imgur.com/QYVa6.gif.
#kobe?
how tempting is that.
They even have small maps with a huge frozen wasteland filled with Barbarians so you can play out your own GoT.
i've been looking for an efficient way to reduce the number of friends I have, so Civ sounds fun.
Small Map.
Civ is so much fun.
Ive got time.
I dont see the problem.
then the game would take a month, easily.
It could be an event for more than one day. Like, take your turn when you get the chance, right?
woofy civ5 game with like 4 people would take... hours.
Civ 5 runs on Mac, Andy your computer should handle fine.
thats a generic-ass baby anyways.
now im gonna age the baby.
I could be down to try. Not sure if my comp can run it though so i have to check first.
Little Ariana Venti^^^.
I'm down.
can we do a massive Civ 5 battle?
Civ 5 is on sale, I bought it.
Use that mike.
I've wanted anything more... Today.
We should do Jon for that.
I don't know.

Twins, amiright?
They did have a sweet suite life.
Twist: Jon marries Zach from the sweet life of Zach and Cody.
It's like a monkeys paw wish. You don't get what you want.
But will it be a female star?
yes.
Will jon live happily ever after with the star of a disney kids show? #yesorno.

no.
Could he take him, sUN? #yesorno.
I googled the dad. You could take him.
*his.
What would Jon offer Ariana though? 50 burritos from Chipotle, 35 Rolling Rock beers, and one childhood photo of is?
No you need to offer it to her father.
Offer her some sweet items. Bitches love legendary items.

he took it off the site before i finished it though.
yeah it was a really good story.
He tries to mcguiver his way off Mars right?
I heard about that story from a YouTube channel I follow.
because a) it got made into a book and b) ridley scott is now directing the movie starring matt damon.
hey woody, do you remember that story you showed me called the martian? it was published online and the author updated it like once a month. it was about a guy stuck on mars.

Jon, i saved this on my phone because i thought it looked delicious and wanted to learn how to make it: http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-thai-mango-with-co-122430.
I thought only the door survived.
Didn't he die at the end? It was Kate winslets character that went on.
I was like Leonardo DiCaprio from titanic, sad but willing to go on with my life.
I didn't. I went on with my life woody.

I am planning on cooking and grilling all day Monday with mike .
We were lying to lure people to Cville.
Naw son.
What's everyone's plans this weekend? LOTR for mike and woody?
I have no doubts, however that Mr Gabriel knows how to party.
Does 3 pit bull songs constitute a kickass playlist?
Your dad knows how to fucking party. I knew that before his kickass playlist.
In the car with my dad. So far his playlist has started with 3 pitbull songs. 
Song of the day shall be "west coast" by coconut records.
Apparently there is over 4 Million.
Weird idea. I mean how long has this been a thing..shouldn't the number of unplayed songs diminish pretty quick.
http://forgotify.com/.
Just because you fuckers are such god damn music hipster fucks.
Jon / everyone, you should check out Kurt Vile if you're looking for new music. Laid back summery hammock music.
>what hell.
>they're not my suited.
I've tried but they're not my suited.
I don't listen to Decembrists.
Ah I forgot that crane wife was them. I liked that one. Sons and Daughters is nice.
My favourite Decemberists song is probably The Crane Wife pts. 2 & 3. Tugs at the ol heart strings.
Same with the Hazards of Love.
Castaways and Cutouts is a great album too.
All of The Crane Wife. That album is beautiful.
I like that song though. 
Suggest some other decemberist songs mike other than Don't Carry It All.
Can. Listen to that playlist you followed and give me suggestions on additions.

Let's just watch porn and criticise the storyline. 
My personal recommendation would be flash gordon, but I'm open to suggestions.
With interludes to yell at jon for having bad taste in women on tinder.
Alright so thoughts. Since I'm not coming to cville, who wants to do a skype viewing of an agreed upon movie this weekend while drinking?
> don't like to woody.
Don't like to woody. Dudes a prude. Be naked on the reg. 
but don't be naked on the reg, thats special treatment for hot ones.
You should be doing regular performance reviews to set a standard. Don't ask, just schedule .
Like what usually happens in dc.
I think the trick is to be a seductive intern and let people come to me.
*part.
Especially not the prt where an intern asks to assess someones performance.
I dont see how that could go wrong.
But also have a piece of paper regarding her performance in case things go south. 
ez.
then just show up naked.
Tell her you need to have a 1 on 1 to assess her performance.
Andy I got your back on office romance.
Also the movie Barbershop is playing in the barbershop.
G *barber*: "yeah put some A1 on that steak".
Guy getting fade: "yo G should I get a part?" *implying a shaved artistic line*.

Hereby the correct emoji symbol for life.

Is there an appropriate hand emoji to covey the gesture that goes along with that quote?
>life, uh, finds a way.
Yeah, but life finds a way.
Gravity always wins.
The movie or the fundamental force?
i actually had a heated argument with a coworker this morning about gravity so maybe im not the best to consult on relationship advice.
chat her up on AIM.
I'm actually laughing out loud.
scottys on fire.
have you tried staring at her.
I know that as an engineer this is out of your relm of expertise but try anyway.
Mike how should one approach attractive coworkers?
Mike pls provide more professional advice.
alternatively "is the space pope reptilian?".
Nailed it.
"does the pope shit in the woods".
Wish there was some way to professionally answer that question as affirmatively as it deserves.

oof the double smackdown.
No, you boner.
Is he still Jon friend? #yesorno.
i'm still jon's friend though, so i got that going for me.
Cause I know I was.
Here's a question: who isn't an awkward blob of puberty in their teenage years?
No disagreements.
I'm sorry for my friend mike, andy.
Yeah mike. What the heck.
I would rather die than have to watch a video of the awkward parts of my teenage years.
hey. that's not nice mike.
much like your teenage years #gotem.
Yeah, but that storyline is often uncomfortable to watch.
The actor who plays theon is so dang good. I'd argue the best in the series.
yes.
sUN did i bring a nerf gun to graduation in efforts to win a nerf war #yesorno.
And yes, hunting humans.
Then the joke was lost on yoy.

I missed the pun thread too. Hearts all around.
Form of ":sheep:".
Groupme, assemble!
the best part is that woofy gchatted me to let me know there was a pun thread going down.
I was also proud of the one that spanned over 2 messages. Your collapse one may have been my favorite though.
"die if i backed out" was underrated excellence, andy. 10/10.
can't beelieve I missed the pun thread.

We should have it. You should make it. Dance for me monkeys.

And if mike is right and its easy to include emojis, then we should have a random emoji feature.
*woofy.

>what hell.
>woodt.
I saw that coming from a mile away woodt.
3) i retract 1.
2) sUN could include emojis in her responses super easily.
Check mate.
Perfect. Come to Cville this weekend.
1) buy me beer and we can discuss.
Guys I really believe in you, and I'm willing to do anything short of actually learning the programming skills this task needs, to help.
Maybe easy, maybe hard, maybe go fuck yourself.
Separate but related question, how hard would it be to get sun to include the groupme emoji's in her regular responses .
How hard would it be to implement custom emoji's for sun to post assuming we already had the image files?
"fuck it this seems fun".
i feel like whoever picks which emojis to make picks them along the same critereon that woody and i use to add features to sUN.
:bee:.
� pornstasche cop is my spirit guide.

Because i know jon, and he's usually on point.
I'm sure that whenever jon chimes in, the jokes will be killer.
Jon quit typing and give us some puns. I know you've got some nectar.
I'm just bumbling along in this thread.
Well i'd die if i backed out now.
Andy your words sting.
Oh honey, do you not get it?
you'd have to comb up with better puns at least.
I agree, what does the hive-mind think?
this is outside my ab-domain of expertise.
Maybe we should try pollen the groupme to see what everyone thinks?
Yea I just don't get the buzz.
I assume you would need to bee in the loop to get it.

I won a elimination game when a guy missed getting my last life with a mad bomber, top decked a flame strike and won. It was something like 20+ to 1 for  six turns.

I like hard carry brood. I think if you do the 20 min single lane crush you can farm really fast and go carry items.
I remember one game Fidel went full HC brood after he rekt a trilane. Got a rapier and necro3 and orchid at like 35 mins.
maybe mek BM?
congrats, you have one hero who will spend the next 45 minutes chipping at one tower.
Take over jungle, slow siege t3.
how to beat brood:
1) buy minute 0 wards.
its not that difficult to beat a trilane as brood, but the problem is, "what the fuck do i do now".
Fidel plays a solid brood.
I honestly find brood pretty easy to deal with if you have a semi coordinated team. Then again, I've never really played against a great brood.
a light breeze can keep BM from going highgruond.
Because hook is OP.
kotl can keep her from going highground, but thats about it.
 Who's the strongest hero now? Why is it pudge.
Yea. Makes sense.
can juke illuminate then he's dead.
Is KOTL too squishy? The wave clear isn't enough?
i dont much care for her.
ds and axe both can stand up and wreck her in offlane.
a bunch of teams have been running her in the offlane, and people have been picking ds to contest her 1v1.
good but countered by dark seer.

Or just bane for infinite duel.
Ghost scepter lc with dazzle as a support.
you can attack and be attacked, but take no damage.
nvm classic dota, many rules for duel.
Leighton can't be tamed.
I don't think Leighton can be prevented from attacking in duel.
I'm only like 60% sure on that.
you attack through it, they can't attack.
What happens if you ghost scepter duel?
be the initiator*.
Idea: Aghs Legion who only builds defensive items. Go Pos 3 and get the initiator against carries who can easily turn fights or escape e.g. Faceless.

I'm aware.
*has.
Stu nothing had ever not happened less than that.
do you like Wendy's?
In the case I'm reading the judge settled a dispute with a coin toss #justice.
Apparently there's a place in West Virginia called Bald Knob. neat.
This article references a bunch of place with strange / offensive names.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dildo,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador.
Thats terrifying.
new favorite sentence of the day.
Went scuba diving there once for scallops, found a bag of dead kittens, didn't go back. The place is strange.
Im sure its a very pleasurable place to live.
but then again, there's a place in Newfoundland called Dildo.
Yeah stu, another 6 hours apparently.
I can't believe there's a place named Bland.

Dont get arrested in southwest virginia.

andy you are the worst prostitute ever.
So Andy, your job is to sit in a car early in the morning with two middle-aged women?
When law school is over, thats going to go from funny to depressing.

the whole periodic table of elements pinned to the corkboard makes the whole thing much classier.
ez.

just my baller-ass state champs ring.
but there are no fun pictures of that.
the part you're missing is that i was also on lacrosse team.
matt show us your childhood.
Mike I feel like we made similar mistakes.
6spooky9me.
these photos are all formatted for your phone wallpapers btw.
Did they tell you they could help you become a model if you did some tasteful nudes?
welp one of my coworkers just called me out for chuckling at my laptop.
and made lots of mistakes helping them with their projects.
I had a couple of friends in photography class.
Stu is looking so hot right now.
water is the essence of wetness.
i was 17? close enough.
Yeah we're all on a watchlist now.
whatever, nice dick, stu.
wait you probably weren't 18 so thats pretty pedo.
nice package.
yup, I was one of them.
source: knew many of them.
swim team kids were weird as fuck.
but I wasn't a kid.
one time I went to mcdonalds in my speedo.
Driving since 630.
by so many do you mean 4?
2 hours to go.
My friends car smelled like mustard for the rest of the summer.
andy how's your car ride going?
This was done at one of the biggest tourist attractions in St John's, Newfoundland, which is the capital city of the province. So many people witnessed it. We were so hungover.
There can only be one hotdog!
Matt you had a mustard fight in the highlands or something.
Matt "bukake" english.
no.
sUN is it opposite day? #yesorno.
Because you're lion!
the explanation is that my friend had a photography class project.
no.
is matt's picture just color-shifted ejaculate? #yesorno.
I dont believe you stu.
Mike I was never a lobster but I was a lion.
my friends and i had a mustard fight once.
Stu there couldnt be an explanation for these pics.
The village people want their sexuality back.
Goddamnit mike beat me.
Speak for yourself.
im already hard.
I'm starting soft.
My worst pic is the groupme avatar but this is amazing.
also "things on my end are about to get pretty gay" thats what he said.
DO IT.
disclaimer.
things on my end are about to get pretty gay.
i used to have sex appeal.
give me a sec.
so, Mike, did you go to theatre school or something?
"Can I get weird with you?" Confirmed best pick up line NA.
i am fucking dying over here.
candlestick weird?
sty pls.
because this is awesome.
can I get weird with you.
Mike.
oh god do i go full retard.
THESE ARE SO GREAT.
omg.
lobster.
latin academy.
for some reason im feeling like getting real weird so i aint done yet.
Immediately sent to liz.
wait are we having an epic facebook photo contest?
god I love where this took us.
the time i was the grinch.
andy, thats style points for days.
Zero effort on my part.
Caleigh baked a cake for me to ask my prom date with.
LOL.
um awkward i think the girl unfriended me so i can no longer get to the prom photos.
and people say romance is dead.
Mike: So suave.
One time I just kidnapped a girl, tied her up and threw her in the back of my trunk. After driving in circles for about 30 min I pulled her into an abandoned warehouse and pulled out a gun. Instead of killing her though it just popped out a little flag that said "Prom?".
you call girls pews?
is that John Stamos?
THAT ARM IS ON A PEW.
She looks terrified.
holy shit, whos that suave looking mother fucker?
hover arm!
the time i didnt shave.
Hang on these are on Facebook, let's get weird.
I once wrote an elaborate thing on the street in chalk.
Matt's an annoying asian girl.
Matt's*.
Anyong?
You're an annoying asian girl.
*snaps*.
*annoying.
*girl.
That's all you have to know.
I'm a delightful asian boy.
jon, story time.
You should ask jon about his prom asking. He did some elaborate shit.
Jon do you have a newsletter I can subscribe to.
On our backs lets have "Prom?" also painted, so we could go to a local high school and cause some high school drama for one unsuspecting boy.
I'd like to be the "!" at the end.
Maybe just no shirts, and we each paint our chest a single letter to spell out guilty. Then instead of reading out verdict aloud we just tear off our shirts and spell GUILTY.
If woody wore that shirt, I'd just have a "what he said".
nvm.
woody had my idea.
That means I'd wear a shirt that says, "This mother fucker is guilty".
No to the former, no to the latter.
Cause I'm making "He's guilty" t shirts.
Better yet, is there a jury dress code?
Can lawyers wear costumes?
*ez.
Ex.
Just wear a mask.
Just have it be opposite day.
What if a serial killer only targets lawyers who defend him. Who would defend him? #deepthoughts.
ChuaN pls.
Ig maid cosplay.
*habeus.
Its called hanbeus butterface.
The right to paperbag in a court room has been recognized since 15th century england.
I'm asking for a friend...
Andy can you defend someone  if they are really ugly.
Ez consent defense.
Andy likes rapists. 
all I know about law I learned from Phoenix Wright.
Plus most cases settle so usually it just involves getting a better deal for your client.
You cant ask a question you know someone is going answer with a lie. But other than that, yeah you should represent to the best of your ability.
What's the deal if a lawyer blatently knows a dude is guilty and they've done a horrible thing. They have to represent them and get them off clean anyway?
Jon would do great as a sexual assault speaker.

Jon = coolest .
That means I'm the coolest. 
I play all the games. Minecraft. Hearthstone. Dota. TF2. 
if i could say shit on the television, i'd be so happy.
DONT YOU WANT TO MAKE ME HAPPY???
I'd be happy if we got one other person to play TF2.
6 or 9 you say.
We can't get a 9 man TF2 team together, but could we do 6?
My Spy too strong.
I wish there was TF2buff.
*snaps*.
Probably why his winrate is so high.
TF2 though.
I haven't played dota with woody in a coons age. 
82.5% win rate with Puck this month. 17 Matches. Dagon tooooooo strong.

Lol Matt.
seriously though, how hard can mappo be? get lvl 3, farm jungle and lane at safe time, get 7 min vlads treads, 18 min aghs, press tab and q a few times, get a blink and ac and solo rosh and end game at 25 mins. sniper is harder to play.
Probably.

Matt's a better meepo than you ever were cam.
Is Matt playing meepo now?

That's probably what I'll do.
why even skill ult.
matt. you should run a single meepo. just never let the other meepos leave the base.
lol. ez dagon shadowblade chen.

75% of the difficulty of playing new bloodseeker is containing your glee when you're running around at 1000 move speed.
carry is fun, jon. new bloodseeker <3.
and during that time we strategically build up the gold advantage on the opposing team, so that when mid-game rolls around we can sit in base and press r and win.
I don't think carry in general is fun.
but that's only for the first 19 mins.
issue with glowballs is, i think, that AFK farming spectre is the least fun part of the gang.
shut up matt. for the love of all christ,shut up.
glowballs is so dang fun. it's been a while since we've had an old-fashioned glowballs stomp.

new meta.
https://youtu.be/x6qEK-r8n1c.
example of aghs + refresher + octarine np:.
new glowballs lineup: gyro aghs, silencer aghs, farming alch aghs factory, clockwerk (for i belieeeeeeeeeeve shots), io for alch relocates at 85 mins.
also heart.
and gaming the comeback mechanics.
and disrespect.
75% of the success of glowballs is confidence in the success of glowballs.
in glowballs? treads aghs refresher octarine ez.
honestly now I would probably go treads -> blink -> aghs -> necro books.
in glow balls NP really doesnt need that much farm.
NP can offlane.
hrm bloodseeker maybe not. i love to move him into the jungle because he farms so fast, and if we have a NP, that would be a lot of resource contention.
in this meta especially.
and yes I agree.
that's the key.
they used invoker instead of spec.
also i think bloodseeker offlane is legit for glowballs. get a couple of levels, get level 6, ez ganks.
stole the idea, but lost. how do you even lose with glowballs?
0-29.
holy fuck that poor jakiro.

And even have sUN bot be a character.
And then transition topics with our shitty puns.

sUN knows.
you think we're gonna lose when we go three of our best heroes matt? WHATCHU EXPECT DAWGGGG.
no.
does matt suck #yesorno.
AND THEN THERE WAS THE ONE WITH BRIAN JON AND I. Remeber that one? Brian was Naga, I was Nigma, Jon you were venge I think and got fucking ruined by a Brood bottom. And we ended up coming back in a crazy way.
Glowballs still just as effective though.
Less epic comebacks.
Yup.
they reduced the rubberband mechanics now didn't they.
I think the craziest one was when Stu and I defended our base for like 40 mins and came back to win. Stu was Necro and had nothing but like brown boots and a staff of wizardry when we started the defense. Ended with aghs dagon 5.
I have had a surprising amount of those games. I remember one where Cam went Storm mid and got fucking REKT the whole while. We lost all outer towers and were down like a million GPM XPM and then Cam got a 35 minute orchid and allchatted "lol gg" and then we came back and won.
that spec game went from "we fucking lost" to "ez gaem" so quickly.
what, you're tired of super bullshit one-hit KO's jon?
I remember that 40 min radiance game. EZ insta-ultrakill and then we won.
Traded out the assassin for a lance.

Andy that glow balls last night was A+.
Spectre-tated.
Hilarious game .
I spectated that .
Ez farm.
One time Matt literally got a 40 minute radiance on spec then we won ez.
Until then just buy mangos as needed.
Any timing before 40 minutes is pretty good.
You go aghs .
For support weaver i'd go radiance.
Woody 1v1 me weaver.
Best build 2k15.
Love it Stu.
 Brown boots -> Dagon-> ocarina core.
Or maybe a lotus orb?
Not for the illusions, for the dispel.
I think Dagon is the best support item for weaver.
Weaver illusions are butt.
Euls for supports, manta for carries.
Which is an item i should try more on that hero when they have silences.
Diffusal win rate is lower than Aghs...
That would make me mad.
I think as weaver you just go diffusal.
Who jumps who? Who knows?
I like the drow weaver matchup. A game of cat and bug.
Yea.
Yeah stu if they like counterpick or something.
its textbook.
The only way I see it working is fooling the team into thinking weaver is core .
yea, scuttle in, minus armor, minus armor, scuttle again, ez kill, ez aghs, ez MMR.
Just go with the minus armor thing.
The build would be medalion into aghs i guess.
#leshrekt.
#rekt.
So how would that be different for woody.
Do it, and feel how useless you are.
AIRSTRIKE INCOMING.
I'm playing support weaver next game.
Cent aghs + Luna aghs.
Yes.
Can you shadow amulet creeps?
Abbadon and cent with aghs would be an awesome combo.
But until he gets aghs weaver is a lane creep.
So dirty.
It would be kinda dirty on a legit support hero.
Use his ult on others!
But srsly if abbadon had that aghs upgrade tho.
Easiest lawyer of my lyfe.
Get fucking rekt woody.
Yea exactly.
Now Recipe for Veil is OP on Weaver. 100% win rate.
Abysal rubik probably has a great winrate too, doesnt mean its good.
I think the win rate is high because you'd only build it if you're already stomping.
Is it like a better venge swap kind of? I don't see a practical use for it, given the hero it's on, but imagine is abby had that kove.
get Lawyered.
Aghs Weaver is 67% win rate...
Aghs weaver is garbage until someone proves otherwise.
/r/iamverysmart.
Best status ever.
Aghs weaver legit support.
AKA: The reason I check Facebook.

maeby has to be oracle, he says maybe a lot.
dummy.
I put knight rider.
>Team arrested development: Morph (aka gene parmesan), Clock (buster bluth), Brewmaster (Lucille), support sven (Steve Holt!), CM (maeby bluth).
and euls' the people at wrong times.
wat.
also dragons and no DK.
as long as every hero gets euls.
wyvern instead of dusa.
fuck.
stu pls.
dragons, and no wyvern.
dragons has to play troll.
I'll play drow so mike can get upset about how i build her.
Team Dragons: jakiro, knight rider, dusa (snakes are new meta dragons), viper, and troll hard carry.
i'll play venge so jon can judge.
lets play a game where we each play a hero someone else is good at so we're all mad about how poorly the hero is being played.
>Team Jonny G: Venge, Omni (jon can't be omni tho), PA, Cent, Axe.
objection: team butts cant be missing pudka.
I think the new andy team would have techies instead of earthshaker.
Team Butts: Lina, QoP, WR, CM, centaur. 
can you make an Archer themed team? go.
i have a literal 0% winrate with doom. shit hero.
Little column a...
both.
i can't tell if "favorite team" is "you hate this" or "you like this".
Brian: pudge, invoker, naga, spec, mirana.
sty pls.
stu who is knight rider pls explain.
brian's all star team.
>knight rider.
I know mikes all start team: lycan, doom, lc, druid all take a jungle camp, alll rush midas.
> Team For Andy (Lina, Tree, CM, KOTL, Earth Shaker)

we did it once and won 100% winrate gg ez mid end fast ti5 champs.
WOODAY's team: clock, knight rider, zip zoop, puck, and pudge.
i'm sorry did you mean WOODAY.
WD, bristle, necro, axe, and space cow.
Woody's favorite team: who the fuck plays any of these characters. 
I know my all star team.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_burn_centers_in_the_United_States.
#sunstrike.
> team fuck this game: Earth Spirit, Clock, Voker, roaming Spirit Breaker, Pudge support.
stus favorite team would be penises because gay.
And a WD.
Stu's favorite team would be a team with a shit ton of health. 
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
do you know how fucking fun it is to run around at 700 move speed.
This would be mikes favourite team ever.
centaur even sounds like an engine starting when he ults.
omg I was so far off on this team.
also centaur, duh.
good call, replace WR with DS.
needs troll, drop invoker.
oh right!
And ty matt.
Team racecar needs ds.
Andy, that was  funny.
God damn if we aren't the greatest minds of this meta.
And it turns out it was old man ezalor the whole time.
> Team racecar (BS, WR, Lina, Jug, Voker).
And dp is the villain with spooky ghosts.
juggernaut is the villian with the mask.
Lina is daphne.
Wind ranger is Velma .
Voker is Fred.
Team No Team: Lycan, Natures, Tinker, two others .

man the story behind stu's gif is hella sad. that dog fell into a tar pit and was completely covered in tar, unable to move. those people are rubbing it with fucking turpentine to get the tar to dissolve. no worries though, the dog survives and is walking around at the end of the video.

One hit KO is hilarious.
One hit ko should actually have es instead of ogre.

Easier to close out a game or to maintain a lead.
True.
Also it doesnt punish early game leads as hard which was undyings biggest problem.

Imagine bouncing hooks tho.
all mid Pudge was pretty successful.
We should play pudge wars finally.
I'm ignoring your last comment.
Loljk.
CD is my fave game mode.
Any mode with Stu is the most fun.
AD is always the most fun.
solo ranked is concurrently the most and least fun game mode.
Bristle is actually a great low MMR stomper.
But until then fuck ranked.
Im just gonna learn to play ta at some point and solo win pub games.
Thats what my teammates spam when picking.
andy just start playing zeus, EZ mmr.
Literally unkillable.
Apparently every ranked game at my mmr needs tank.
Octarine adds like 450 HP.
Because who the fuck needs tank or mobility.
Ocarina Tinker ez CD.
Brown boots ocarina best bb build.
yes.
Would it reduce cd on things like bash?
BB ocarina is stupid good.
Viper ocarina ez.
You should definitely rush ocarina on every hero who casts spells.
Also remember our game yesterday where woody was getting smoked mid by an invoker but then we came back and won? Good times.
Yeah 1.5 second ult cd.
With aghs and ocarina you could spam for days.
Ive seen a bunch of pros like sumail building it on him in pubs and it seems like the cd reduction on all his spells could be sweet.
Pa maybe? Who only does righclick damage?
No I haven't.
Which hero building ocarina core on would make mike the most mad?
Brian have you tried ocatarine core on invoker yet?
Ez 19min megas.

Dixie Normus changed name to Brian.
I've been practicing my Michael skills for 25 years.
Because they were the person better at micro.
Also there have been teams where someone other than the visage would control the birds.
http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view6/2605490/mine-was-better-o-s.gif.
Yeah it wouldnt happen in a pro game, but in a pub if someone is not as good a meecro it might.
see: my vest.
see: saw.
see: visage.
see: mappo.
except that the pros can already meecro 2 things,so jungling and pushing isn't hard.
Andy I bet that will happen during ti.
they're actually going dual mid. this looks like dota 1.
Yeah that makes sense.
SF.
fuckin smoked him.
Who do they have mid?
YOURE A THING.
Safelane centaur is a thing.
That would be a clever thing to do. After you get aghs on druid, you share unit control and a support jungles with your hero while your bear split pushes.
da eff.
TongFu gets a centaur carry.
#clevergirl.
Stu i could just turn on shared unit control and she could pick a hero to afk in base as.
First bans in Tongu vs HGT: Undying, SpaceCow, Gyro, QoP. What a time to be alive.
If only we could make it where Andy is LD with aghs and Liz just controls bear.

first one to get broken up with wins.
Can we do a 2v2 tournament with each guy and their gf on a team? Same rules as the pro+caster tournament.
Basically draft like Andy.
so is andy boosh.
Spiders are creepy.
"That guy looks gross. Ban him".
$$$$$$.
Then we should twitch stream them drafting teams.
idk, penis size?
then boyfriend coaches GF. GF with best MMR proves... something.
Someone else get a girlfriend so they can be a 5 stack.

And then veno because liz is afraid of snakes.
Just ban all bugs.
Write disrespectful question marks in all chat after each pick.
Nyx ban.
But then random everything else.
brood and weaver bans.
Always.
*Casper, the friendly ghost.
First ban brood.
Caster*.
Confuse the fuck out of a faster.
> Andy hates spiders, so we ban Broodmother. And he loves bears, so we pick Ursa.
Just let time expire.
All random our team.
ban no heroes. let the time expire. maximum disrespect.
And just say that they trigger us.
Can we just always ban the same 5 heroes?
Dragons lifestealer first pick first ban.
I think the most important things to remember is be disrespectful to the other team, be supportive of each other and blame dragos if we lose.
I'm always hard for cowboy butts.
Is the world ready for a try hard cowboy butts?
There are 9 of us. Im sure someone can do it.
Worst case scenario we cant do it.
I don't wanna sign up then find out I'm at a wedding or something.
Idk, lets sign up though.

he did go early travels, but i didnt catch the beginning of the game so i dont know the exact order.
he also gets a bottle from time to time as well.
thats what i've been doing now.
gotcha. did he go yasha into travels like he usually does?
he played well, but the way the draft worked, he was the only core who scaled for them, whereas hr had storm, gyro and huskar. they were behind and didnt have the late game so they just lost eventually after defending highground for awhile.
How'd he end up doing? He plays that hero a decent bit on stream.

Captains draft is the best mode in dota IMO.
idk, you picked the qop we wanted to pick, so that was a small victory.
Yeah it was fun. I'm a bad captain. But was fun.
i enjoyed our 4v4 captain's draft game.
We should do more 1v1s w casters haha. Or 2v2 tourny.
I'd tune in just for the commentary.
Although if there was a professional scene of cereal dropping, I'd watch a few games. 
I just dropped an entire bowl of fruity pebbles on the ground. Not pro.
which makes it a classic woody thing to do.
that's too fucking pro.
i could see WOODAYYY doing that.

You should just refer to sUN whenever someone pitches you an app idea.
I told them not to do it.
Andy's Family had an app idea once.
A good director must be bitter and narrow minded.
All it has done is make me super bitter to any creative app idea.
Woody quit being so modest.

But the company is like 80 people, so it isn't as cool as it sounds.

Almost 4 years (but some was Intern time).
Cool though that your company is doing really well though. How long have you been with them?

Wrong. Ever tp into lane and get glimpsed back? Then your a super poor support so you don't have boots yet so you have to walk. Might as well just DC it's so shameful.

you wont watch this but you should.
and a venge.
Team back and forth.
and, i dont know, a disruptor?
then an earth spirit.
ez.
mike. we should do a tiny toss the tusk in. then the tusk walrus kick's the enemy back at our team.
can't wait for TF2 later. Everyone pls download if you don't have it already so we can all play.
Yeah but we had a hell of a time.
Yeah then you lost.
that shit was so funny.
were you in that game where the guy was successfully kicking away the sandking when he'd epicenter?
* some exceptions may apply.
it's hilarious but... practically fucking useless.
when they patch it such that you can kick allies, i will play tusky again.
I'll get the whole team killed before I bail on a unsuccessful smoke. Someones gonna die.
Mike you should start playing tusk again. That Walrus kick is way too hilarious for us not to use disrespectuflly.
haha reminds me of the bloodlust we always get when we smoke. SOMEONE'S GONNA FUCKIN DIE.
Nope. Cause I'm too tunnel visioned and busy internally saying "shhhhhhh shhhhhhh".
Yea. Did you know if you use voice commands it will show as the team member you are disguised as?
^ I always thought that was neat.
"The idea for the Spy originally came from a Quake glitch, which caused players of the enemy team to appear as allies.".
Spys that use that shit murder waves.
yea, its super good.
I'll be on like 6, but can only play for like an hour.
You should try and get good at using the deadringer with spy.
I'll show you tonight.
the surprise sky attack as soldier wins like 99% of the time. Just crouch then jump.
That shit was too high skill for me. Demo and soldier jumping is too difficult.
i like soldier but im trash tier at tf2.
Soldier is super fun once you start rocket jumping around.
Dragos would play strictly Medic.
I can see matt playing a demoman or soldier.
Theres nothing more dominant than a heavy pyro uber. Simply changes the game.
Scouts are basically invincible against Demoman, Spies and Snipers which is like 50% of pubs.
Who's the enigma? I'll be that giy.
Spy, Scout, Pyro are the Earth Spirits.
essentially the right clickers of TF2.
Medic, Heavy, Sniper.
da bomb.com.
Stu is a bomb engineer.
and Sniper.
Bad at Engineer.
Spy, Scout, Pyro.
also pyro, you're a bomb pyro as well.
cause that class is too fucking difficult.
I'd say you're our best spy player.
You forgot "don't", you dolt.
what's your best class wood.
Bad on the hallway maps though were its all demo, heavy, med and soldier.
they think it be like it is, but it do.
I can rock some faces with scout.
You are what you is.
I've never seen an impactful scout player before. probably cause the skill level is too high and all I play with is nubs.
bout to throw down some big plays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jamuLPfQibU.
Get syched for some TF2.
Everyone go ahead and like andy's last message.
Alternatively, this is my groupme this is my gun, this is for dota, this is for puns.
This is my groupme. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
this is my groupme today. Me. My own. My words. NOT YOURS.
Woody and Stu, lets play TF2 tonight. PLS.
And I wish everyone would play TF2. If I was to put my role on a team that I play best for TF2, definitely Heavy or Medic. I'm an ass pyro and an even more ass spy.
I think i'd like that more.
like the force staff.
side note: can you change the blink dagger's double tap to blink you forward rather than toward your fountain.
kidding, woody probably does have those pics! HA! got'em.
thats no way to speak to a man about his fiancee mike.

our team name will be Wu Tang Clam.
Engy is situational pick, always need a medic through.
or engy.
I'll medic.
Maybe an engineer.
they've been adding player rating and stuff.
so pick a class, we will need Medic, Demo, Soldier, at least 1 scout, prob a heavy.
yea jawesome.
It will probably be 6 on 6 Highlander format.
Yep! Jon told me about it.
they are adding it aren't they?
If TF2 adds competitive match making, we are making a 6 person team FYI.

Will Jon make an inappropriate comment to a hooters waitress and get thrown out? #yesorno.
I'll give a live feed .
I hope it is. Might be funny. 
alone at a hooters sounds like maybe the saddest thing ever.
I might have to solo a fucjing hooters. Only place near me that I know has it.

"My patch" also refers to woodys pubic hair.
Mike we talked about this yesterday.  My penis is 6.84 inches. This is my patch.
I don't think you have the capability to put 6 inches woody.
All of our disrespectful stuff.
There's a 20k prize for dota video. Can we put together a glowballs compilation.
I don't think they uploaded our picture just yet.

Liz said she's concerned for your health tonight Andy. You better prove her right.
Also dota tomorrow, drinking today. I finished my goddamn exams.

I'm 95% certain that my transactions with steam are more secure than with my bank.

we're doing office Olympics today. My paper airplane making skills are about to win the fucking Gold.

I always thought jon was the coolest.
I always thought that mirror shield was always the coolest.
what were we talking about again.
but the quest to get it is so elaborate, i've often passed over it.
and if you can get the biggoron's sword, you can really get some work done.
ehhhhhhh you need the master sword to really get any work done, even though the ocarina gets all the hype.
you have to be aware of who has an ocarina of time on the opposing team, and then lose.
its not too weird. same shit can still work. you have to be aware of lotus orb, and not cast stuff.
I've played like 3 games of 6,84 and it's still the same game. But now it's adopted a more southern climate with mangoes and a desert terrain.

I'm not racking my brain for random shit that annoys woody.
You can buy crickets by the 1000 online, so let's just chip in, get 10 000 crickets, release them into Woody's house, and convince him that he's about to endure the Seven Plagues.
My favorite non-main character is Gail the Snail.
http://i.imgur.com/Xej4zUO.gif.
Would you play nightcrawlers?
lets sneak into woody's house and live in a closet somewhere and let raccoons into his house and his garbage.
I'd like to think that we would live off of discounted cat food.
I like mike's scenario because that means we live together in a trash hole.
See the Burn $20 comment.
All income is disposable technically.
"a disposable income" is very different than "disposable income".
Although that requires me to get a job first so dont hold me to that second one.
Andy you're still in School, you're like 10 steps back.
Also a disposable income.
Fun fact i'm going to have free time when you have children.
i'm going to move in with jon and establish a homeowners association and compel woody to paint his house some silly color he doesnt want to paint it.
I'll also move next to you and be that weird neighbour who's always naked.
slowly reduce the land value of your property.
I'm going to move next to you and completely trash my house.
and also teach your dog to be a little racist so you feel uncomfortable taking it on walks.
Stop trying to invade my suburbia life.
im going to sneak into your house every night and play with your dog and teach it to love me and not you.
I'm not going to be sad when I have your children's love.
Also a fun fact: You can MAKE BREAD FROM BONES.
fuck you i can kidnap a child today.
Fun Fact: I'll have kids when you're still alone and sad.
Exactly, mike.
i bet jon would even teach her that snow white is a poor role model for young women, and that she should strive to find happiness not through a man, but though her own self esteem, and woody wouldn't even think to teach that.
She's going to have such a great time. We're going to spend the day together getting all the autographs of all the disney princesses.
shut up buckles.
Woody not only will we take pictures at Space Mountain, i'm going to take your daughter to meet Snow White, her favorite disney princess.

mike gets a 8.5/10.
sike he's a great dad.
my father used to hit us, that's not cool.
Like your sister, I can take a lot of abuse.
i dont know why you're the target for my abuse today woody, but here we are.
woody couldnt figure out how to unbend a paper clip.
sicker burn than Mance Rader.
sickest burn this side of the salem witch trials.
when woody was asked in elementary school what he wants to be when he grows up, he wrote "the understudy for the "heart" guy on captain planet".
"good, woody" - Brian.
your right.
Spelling matters.
If your right at all like you right now, it will be bad.
I'll just write insults to an imaginary person I don't know and keep going.
I bet woody doesn't poop in a toilet. He poops in Tupperware and puts it in the trash.
If I'm bored this weekend, I might right some nonsensical fiction that has no plot to it at all.

I literally saw max take a poop in a plastic container, hide it in Tim's closet, and he didn't find it until the end of the year.
Woody "The Poopetrator" Zantzinger.
Tim did that to Max a few years ago when I lived with them. It was fucking hilarious.
I'll just poop ON YOUR FACE.
better yet!
no!
no wait. Gonna hide it in your moms room.
I'm going to poop in a sack and hide the sack in your room.
The asianess is rubbing off.
OK calm down Chinese woody.
Your children will then be returned to you. Spoiled by my love that you can never give them.
Twist, I'll put all my daughter up for adoption because I only want sons.
I'm going to come to your house while you're at work and leave all your dairy out so that when you come home you have to deal with a bunch of spoiled dairy and that's just gross.
We're gonna take pictures at Space Mountain. Your daughter is going to say, "Jon I wish you were my dad". I'll be like, "I know, I know".
Wow rekt.
I'm going to Disneyworld. And I'm gonna take your future children. We're gonna have fun without you woody.
and then make a pun about Andrew Jackson and say "Sick Burn".
*ok.
I owe you $25 so on.
I'm going to take a $20 bill and burn it and then burn you with it.
Everyone go ahead and give hearts to mike's comments above.
I'm not sure why.
Woody I'm going to buy you six beers then pour them out in from of you.
Jon you're the man.
I'd rather buy 6 beers than the compendium. I like the game, I don't care about the effects. I play fucking Nethack for god's sake.
Elon Musk is the man. 
i guess ill bite the bullet and buy it this time ; damn peer pressure ; anyone doing hard drugs cause im down for that too.

that blackhole does look sweet though...
woody think about all the joy that dota has brought you. this groupchat wouldnt even exist if it werent for dota. don't you think its time you gave back?
you guys watch this elon musk power wall video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKORsrlN-2k.

Octarine was really great on DP cause of the cooldown reduction. 6 second silence with an 8 second CD. And DP needs tankiness which octarine provides. And all it all, it's not that hard to build.

I wish I could torrenta large pepperoni pizza.
there's even freeware for most applications you'd want to download.
Might download lightroom or some shit.
truth.
Theres nothing worth torrenting now a days. I sat down thinking i'd try torrenting movies, applications, or something and theres nothing that things like netflix, spotify or steam aren't already doing better.

unhype, it's not on yet. but soooooooon.
Must...study....exam....must....ignore...dota.
FUCK there's a pro match hapenning and its a 684 match and Internet is down at work FUUKKKK.
Also people would want to see shirtless dota in houses.
Dude if I am over people would pay to watch us doto and get hype and look for shot glasses.
"Will drink whole gallon of milk during next stream".
I think I might try and set up a stream sometime. My whole thing has to be gimmicks though. "Will eat 6 ghost peppers at certain goals".
� squirrel on Matt .
Classic dota consistency.
I like Andy. 
Repel doesnt get reflected back.
Axe's "get fuggin dunked on bitch!".
Tricked ya, Baron!
They better update the voice packs for that item. Potential to have some great lines. 
No.
Like you have a turn rate and such?
Sort of? Mostly.
So with LO does your hero actually do the spell back?
I remember I saw a rubick that had omnislash and did that once. 
Also fun: omnislash. Immediate dbz fight.
Update: alch first pick.
Yes you do Jon but the directions are screwy iirc.
And is compendium out?
If you force staff someone with lotus, do you get force staffed .
So is it the actual update?
no.
sUN? #yesorno.
Other than to just not use the spell you were gonna use.
Stop being a bitch ez.
Is there any way to stop the lotus shit. 
Because it works exactly like you hope it does.
Fun thing is calling Tiny Tony.
Also hilarious is Tony's toss with lotus.
It should bounce over to ypu.
Repel isn't a debug Jon.
Umm I doubt it.
It should repel you.
If you repel someone who has lotus on, does that get rid of it.
Ez deso ocarina of time.
Crit mom phase Zeus you wont.
Ez mask of madness zeus.
You wont.
Bloodtone into lifesteal.
Three days of Jon losing, why would anyone want to watch that?
Someone live stream his game pls.
Jon get stream so I can stream you next 3 days.
First game of 6.84 is going to be ranked. Ez Zeus mid gg.

Me. Or anyone who drafts that skill in ability draft. 
But who can repel?
*Repelled .
So if you're bkb you don't miss any more?
Don't forget about that as well. 
I am omniknight.
Also the radiance thing is of note: its not that your hero gets evasion- everyone getting burned misses. So better in team fights .
Yeah but LD had problems late game before. Will be super interesting.
Cam, after hearing the commentators and pros talk about LD aghs, they all say it will suck until it's his 4th item or so lol.
Watching RTZ stream. He bought 6 midas to end the game disrespectfully. 
Tell him to buy a single fish_stick with it.

blink + long con.
you'd have to rush blink force to get in position though.
yeah, i've always wanted to do the disrupter fountain glimpse.
could do some fun shenanigans with the vision + disruptor glimpse on spawn.
smoke works in fountain right? didnt i see something on reddit about that?
rofl.
SOMEONE BUYBACK TO GET TECHIES OUT OF OUR FOUNTAIN.
yeah, there are definitely ways to abuse it i think. like imagine if you teamwipe and can setup right outside their fountain for like 30 seconds.
techies can put the sign in enemy fountain, and spawncamp you lol.
If techies gets a refresher can he also make another sign to make another area retarded .
glad we could sort that out.
i take it back, techies balanced.
literally uncounterable.

ez.
and get an aghs from alch.

alright, someone explain to me how this isnt broken. techies aghs, gets the sign that makes mines invisible to everything. places sign in rosh pit and puts a shit ton of mines there. nothing the other team can do about it.

420 blaze it #now.
yeah i saw, makes sense, that would be so unfair.
they fixed shallow graving wraiths.
maybe get mangos on necro so you can always pop one to heal.
icefraud pls.
>Fixed Combined wards granting 100 bonus HP.
necro also isnt that hard to dive and kill...
i think basically it will be while your lane is pushed on dire you can positon yourself to hurt ancients, and then stack while lane is away from you.
stumarrize it for me.
and at max level no more than 2 min by ancients.
http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=159343.
thats a good point. goodbye offlane tower.
good luck doing that while also having a presence in lane.
lol, it requires you to be in proximity for long periods of time.
you _can_ do it from radiant... much less efficient tho.
only for dire offlane though.
stack ancients.
necro offlane is going to be big.
i think plan will end up being SUPER DEFENSIVE TRI around alchy for like 5 minutes, he gets midas + treads + basi, then they send him off to the jungle.
and then you get the aghs for tiny first, then aa or wd.
or necro.
LD.
neg armor aoe.
and then an offlaner who can get aghs but doesnt need it early.
also, WD and alch are great synergy.
i do think tiny, wd, aa and alch would be good.
ultra kill instead.
hard gaem.
team ganks.
I'm supporting as WD.
^.
ez gaem.
other team ganks alch, the squishiest hero ever, because you have a jungler and one support.
not wit halch!
oh, you mean alch gets his aghs for him.
lol it'd take 5ever to get an aghs in jungle.
while mid and carry get farmed.
and then he gets agh.
but if it's a #4 tiny.
yeah so... medium efficient.
kind of like a support pudge thing.
it works very well.
toss jungle creep.
oh ok.
tiny jungle? how does he do that? why does he do that? this strategy depends on a decent laning stage for alch.
pull mid.
I think he'll be great with an alch.
did you see tiny jungle?
i think tiny would be dirty.
yeah we just need to find the perfect lineup to take advantage of it.
Farm cam aghs on LD, me tinker aghs and sty WD. We win 20 min.
k nvm. That sounds boring as dick. 
and the last one you eat.
and then 2 more.
and then another.
and then you farm another.
like a salve or something i think.
no he feeds it to people.
I'll try too. I'm enjoy supporting and farming. Someone just has to explain what I do with the aghs, if anything. Does he just hold it then everyone has it?
aghschemis.
*alch.
i can practice.
i'll play aghs, but idk about farming.
ultimate disrespect.
andy?
we need someone's good at farming and willing to play alchemist.
you need to build aghs before the patch.

Theres a girl CS major thats super hot i'm seeing for the first time. It's like seeing a black astronaut.
Ahh I see.
i know, but the way the venge aura works is that it stays on you until venge respawns. i was curious if it would permantently put the aura on someone because venge hadn't respawned. if it did work like that it would have to be a bug.
Killing a hybrid does not kill morph.
You turn back into morph with whatever health and mana you had before you hybrid when hybrid ends or the hybrid is killed.
probably not.
i wonder if you kill morph while he hybrids venge if you keep the negative aura indefinitely.
although venge illusions do carry the aura.
yeah apparently it does not, you are correct.
i know it gives plus damage, but does the aura itself effect illusions.
No its + dmg.
because if so, tb, venge morphling would be an absurd draft.
question, does venge aura affect illusions?
if rubik is like playing ability draft, playing morphling is going to be like playing ardm.
You are correct. 
so no adaptive strike until it wears off.
but you would still be mirana.
19 seconds????????
THE FUCK.
FUCK you could adaptive strike before that and its off CD again at the end.
adaptive strike into real arrow into fake arrow.
My god... Real mirana arrow, fake mirana arrow, adaptive strike. 14.5 seconds of stun.
one of my favorite moments as rubik was stealing sunder, then having a viper gank me, standing there doing nothing until i got low, sundering and killing him.
Also from last night I am reminded that sunder is the biggest fuck you of a spell.
can meepo poof to a morphling who hybrids him? can morphling poof to meepo?
Copy a mirana. Ez arrow to adaptive strike.
but what if you disrespecfully summon him.
...no way you get to keep a bear.... 
Techies es and omni sound so strong. Tb is cool but that hero is so squish without mega farm.
...that is a really good question.
Can you summon a disrespecful spirit bear? and he stays w you?
i mean you sacrifice a hero when you pick him, but the stun he has is still really strong, and if you pick the right lineup he would have a lot of flexibility on who to copy depending on the situation.
double edict on lesh for pushing isnt bad.
carries literally cant farm because all creeps are taken.
Double Chen for ultimate army of creeps.
its just so absurdly strong i think.
double vacuum and extra ion shells for ds.
375 bouncing to all tracked targets twice.
double bounty, with the shurakin buff thats a shit ton of damage.
Blink axe shit.
double omni is really good.
Ez 2 bkbs.
Double omni.
with tusk you could make a circle.
lol, yeah if you do it wrong.
Double fissure can be more of a pain in the ass to both sides though.
double fissure.
all of jakiro's non ultimate spells are pretty strong.
speaking of pugna stuff, double blast on towers.
you could have like 10 tb illusions at once with manta on the original tb.
tb illusion, double metamorph.
Double nether ward.
Undy tombstone!
whose stats does morph get?
thats obnoxious as shit.
^.
Techies suicide and mine.
really any extra disable.
double hex as lion or ss.
use 2 strong invoker spells.
What are the most broken things new morph can do? Double tombstone is up there I think.
there are so many absurd synergies with the new morph, i think he's gonna be one of the most banned heros in the upcoming patch if only because teams dont know what to expect.
Woody did you know that a new morph illusion can make extra stones for ES?
No boots dusa more viable.
I just want to able to kick allies too...icefrog pls.
no boots tusk new meta.
Literally no damage. More useless than a ward.

http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/344vdw/lotus_orb_all_targeted_spells_interactions/.
did you test it?
weird, the post i read says neither gets the damage.
if duel is reflected the winner gets double the reward.
so if doom casts doom on a lotus target, and they have aghs, it might make sense to run at doom.
so apparently spells reflected by the lotus thingy get aghs upgrades based on whether the person who has the lotus has aghs.
Yup literally just watched the necro video.

#now.
With the new gold mechanics necro gets rich too.
the fuck.
Blink by 5 minutes with necro.
You can get 2 rosh by 20 minutes .
so thats a HUGE advantage to the strat.
Yes .
its like a 430 or 5 min rosh.
Yep.
doesnt necro get rosh as well?
Then Zerg rush 5 minutes in.
I think both teams.
dire now goes 1 safelane, one mid, one jungle, one offlane, one ancients.
Yes you could get contested but if you're dire it's such a safe area to farm.
Yea I did that too it's super easy.
that _hassssssss_ to get patched out.
There's a new necro lvl 1 ancients farm too.
aghs --> ocarina --> new BoTs --> refresher.
also super ez with Q having 3.75 cooldown and 11.25 sec cooldown on dagon.
52.5 sec cooldown on ult.
yes.
can you, lategame, get 4 people in the ground unable to buyback at once?
Ez kills ez ocarina.
Just tried it.
Necro is broken in this meta.

Lol.
Life assimilate morph I mean.
Morph hybrid lifestealer, morph assimilate earth shaker, lifestealer assimilate Es, lifestealer infest storm spirit. (Nuke Armed) storm ball lightning into 5, infest/es ult/morph infest/waveform storm remnant BOOOOOOOOOOOOM! Teamwipe .
No cam. What's that cam?
Did you guys see the 6.84 tactical nuke.
No to everything. Family things. 
i will be finished my last exam.

What are you doing in NOVA? Just don't do that and do Cville.
I'll be in NOVA this weekend .
Guarenteed successful grave.
I saw. They would have to fix that.
Dazzle can shallow grave a hero who becomes a wraith from wraith king aghs.
faster regen but more expensive and disable is longer.
I would say balanced.
*matt.
Woody, heart got buffed recently, didnt you see?
lol jsut realized lotus works on force staff.
fuck you sUN.
Something went wrong.
#gif GOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLL.
or better yet.
best new dunk.
bloodseeker + enigma + tusk. rupture someone, kick them into black hole.
You guys figure out all the combos and figure out what hero yA want me on when I'm back. I'm ready for some tinker NS and alch to farm me aghs.
and if you're REALLY GOOD you can double amp it, so 1400 damage.
There's been a lot of 4+ heart comments today. We're all apparently feeling pretty generous.
60% of 1200 damage, multiplied by a 40% amp, -> 720 * 1.4 = 1008 pure damage.
>infinity damage.
level 2 ES can roll at you, then kick you forever away. jesus chroist. also remember when we tested earth spirit + bloodseeker woody? rupture and stone them, then kick them right before stone expires. infinity damage.
�.
😎.
"Hey antimage can you buy back?".
gg.
no buyback.
kill carry EZ before 10 minutes.
also necro.
You could kick someone from the first bounty tune to under the mid tower. Plus ES would actually be able to use the aghs at level 1.
Insta kill anyone with a 40 to 20sec cooldown.
Obviously the best early aghs is lion.
gank on mid becomes 5 min. ultra kill.
I still think tinker.
ES would be most op. You would be able to kick people under tower in any lane from level one.
Coming home in 20. Let's doto.
So can undy tombstone and Phoenix ult and def blast near them = gg.
Literally maphacking.
Nightstalker with the improved nightvision thing is nuts.
Mrs. Krabappel And Principal Skinner Were In The Closet Making Babies AndI Saw One Of The Babies And Then The Baby Looked At Me.
Me and mike saw it.
big ol' flower of SHUT UP.
what about night stalker and tinker.
cam and i saw it last night, can confirm it's hilarious looking.
I wanna try his blast.
but with no CD.
But then he only can invoke 1 spell.
Who is only balanced by the fact that they're super squishy? The stats at lvl 1 are nothing to joke about.
are there more than earth spirit where the aghs works pre-6? meeps, LD.
Invoker gets invoke at level 2 w reduced cd.
true.
Well thats true for basically all heroes.
but you dont get upgrade until level 6?
axe would be pretty broken too.
maybe earth spirit? level 1 batrider on steriouds.
Sty on my team lol.
witch doctor.
actually fuck it.
3 Meepos at level 3 though.
tree.
The doctor .
Or ld .
Meepo.
Who would be the most broken hero to start with aghs. I say tree.
"dude, gravity-boost isn't a real thing. stop making shit up, you're high".
planetary tour is the bitchinest idea... "what if we just gravity-boosted around all the planets".
i.e. penises.
WHEN THE PLANETS ALIGN.
skins vs. skin tubes.
Flandro invented grand planetary tour.
I'm down with the reverse captains draft, but why can't it be skins vs. more skin?
reverse captain's draft, everyone who is drafted (1) has to have an aghs upgrade, and (2) gets to cheat to get an aghs at minute 0.
i dont know who he is, but i like his sense of style.
he just retired finally, but dude was still using iMacs, rolling around in old man sunglasses and sweatsuits.
Mike you may know of him, the list actually belongs to Gary Flandro.
We should also do a shirtless Inhouse where we reverse captains draft when the updates out.
That stroboscope though...surprisingly useful tool.

also naga net is now dispellable, sad panda.
I'll play Oracle solo support all day.
i need more information about oracle... oracle + bloodseeker? no penalty for bloodrage for however long, crazy damage. god i fucking love new bloodseeker.
Dear Black People Meat - I also tried to nerf Earth Spirit so you would stop losing 1v1 mid but I could only do so much.
#gif challenge accepted.
Did you see them try to nerf axe? Icefraud wrote me a letter. It said "Dear Blackpeoplemeat, Your Axe too good, Dunks OP. Your omni is good too, but he yells at Dragos and the gay kid too much. Try and go 30-2 now. -Love Icefraud".
Lol core naga siren for 5s net.
But yeah.
I meant euls yourseld.
Euls gets purged.
And euls only saves you for like 2 seconds.
Low cd on the ability though. Only aa ult or euls applies.
Dota Argument, the counter is always Black Hole, Chrone, Euls, AA Ult or Doom.
So even bh refresher doesnt cover you.
And the cd is 40 seconds.
Ok so you basically have to commit a huge ultimate just to stop him from raping your team.
Any argument? There is always black hole.
Black hole!
Can't purge call.
Chrono to disable but not kill.
Lol.
Chrono.
Call wont work.
Debuff mike.
Duel, berserkers call.
You fear nothing.
Also imagine being unable to be disabled on storm woody.
One of those he no longer cares about.
The only reason you ever buy bkb on huskar is either pure damage or disable.
I dunno, the Invis was so nice for surprise initiate.
Ez dunk.
They'll nerf it.
I think its gonna be broken.
Yes ice blast will help at the end, but its still 8 seconds of huskar not giving a fuck.
Ice blast ez.
He will be at full.
I still don't think its that strong! A single person buff for 7 seconds. Jon (Omni) can get the whole team!
And thats doubled.
But the amount of heal huskae gets from lifestealing at low health and from his q is insane.
There are things.
no guarantee for full health, damage is still done.
Duel, ice blast, static link, enfeeble, essence shift.
And he is guarenteed full health at the end.
You cant kite him.
How is that fair on huskae.
Otherwise its broken.
Ok so like 2 spells counter it in the whole game.
Jon, omni got a buff.
cast time on heal from .4 to .3.
You can't purge some stuff. Doom, ww ulty.
And of he has lifesteal he heals to full.
Your carry is untouchable for 8 seconds.
Because there are moves that go through bkb.
Aight I'd missed that. Intriguing. 
I still don't think its OP.
Its more than that though.
Its basically BKB and Dazzle in one move.
Aka legion w aghs Andy.
Is broken.
Zero item oracle.
Andy: "I will debate this until I win or one of us dies".
No items.
Im talking about oracles new ult.
Wtf are you talking about.
What item?
Nope. Item too expensive. He's not gonna get it. 
And yeah, but in pubs he's gonna be the new es.
Oracle, yes. 
Im talking about oracle.
How do you see pick and win rate by skill? Isn't there a way.
Im confused what you're talking about.
In any case he's not in CM. not relevant.
I ain't seen it.
...?
And high level players do complain about him.
octarine core, soul booster + mystic staff.
Its his normal ult.
WOODAY REMEMBER.
What item? Its not aghs.
I play him a lot.
He has strong moves, I don't think he is OP.
The item is retardedly expensive andy.
It already was, now its insane.
How often do we play against an oracle and birch about it?
He isn't.
Bullshit, that hero is so broken.
I don't think oracle is that overpowered... Doesn't get abused at high level play or complained about.
Or slark.
Or an ursa.
Thats so broken.
You die.
How do you deal with a storm?
How do you deal with a huskae with that on him?
Continually removes debuffs.
We didnt talk about oracle. Cd on ult got nerfed but the spell itself is now nuts.

1st rule motherfuckers.
Why are we talking about this.
Your curiosity sparks as you ask him to see this world of underground street fighting. 
Which explains why he kicks so hard.
And then it turns out the pottery barn was an undercover ring for street fighting. 
I wanna see a ten man astral imprisonment.
time will tell, but i think bulldog will just wreck face with it.
but he can be lategame. free recall on 3s CD is free splitpush, radiance gives evasion, bkb-piercing root. i think you can play him different.
Mike, its 2 kinda shitty heroes. So at best 1.5 heroes.
And he can kick things really hard. 
You see the kid years later. He has a beard and works at the pottery barn. 
fukin rekt.
yes.
sUN, was Jon Tusk? #yesorno.
Tusk is like that one goofy kid in high school everyone thinks is funny but no one actually talks to.
it's a free extra hero.
objection: you're now playing 6v5.
But we'll see.
I dont think ld aghs is broken only because that hero needs so many items and isnt the greatest late game hero.
I want to play pos 4 naga.
While everyone is focused on the crazy new combos, I'm going to build eBlade, Aghs Pudge. They'll never expect it.
tusk aghs is brokenly fun, the other team will ragequit because they're not having as much fun as tusk.
LD*.
Yea I'm gonna practice my lad.
Lone druid aghs is broken IMO.
They'll have the best ideas.
also lone druid aghs is dirty beyond reason.
I can't wait to watch pros .
I CANT WAIT TO DOTO.
you can get a midas at less than 2 minutes if you get freefarm + rune.
categories: (1) needs aghs, hates to waste the slot [tiny, meepo], (2) wouldn't normally buy aghs but would be nice to have [sven, luna], (3) poor ass supports [tree, lion, AA].
ill farm an aghs for your meep any day.

(not easy on all of them, i guess. tree could farm it).
things that temper that: farming aghs is not easy on any of these heroes, alch still has to have the space to farm these aghs for other heroes, and the new intelligence items are super expensive.
that was be hilarious.
Brood builds a huge spider wave (15+) and charges the offlane tower alone. Aghs NP ults and counters with new 15+ tree force.
My initial reaction to this patch without having played it is that its completely stupid.
team "hit it and quit it".
like you were never even there....
I'm coming up with some new disrespectful plays. I like the Morph + SB + Lifestealer Combo. Duplicate SB, get SB in LS, LS in SB copy. Charge someone, every one expodes out, use SB ult, Hop back together and charge back out.

i want a tusk change where if you kick someone while they're in the air from punch, they go even further.
I would like to request a video of lina Laguna herself.
Also lotus orb and the core whatever are expensive as FUCK.
Don't ignore that it's super fucking hard for supports to farm an aghs. Weaver won't be a support. 
I'll get into it later but lo is super hard to use because you have to manually cast it, it's not like linkens.
Also can Weaver be a support? Rush aghs, max bugs?
Icefrog pls.

if he doesnt cancel.
omg thats actually so good against sniper since you have time to react.
see if it is different.
once again try on a hero with less actives than doom.

stealing a move just replaces steal????
wait nope i have steal on doom now wtf.

its ok i wanted to feel like shit at work tomorrow anyways.
and if it doesnt work with doom try it on a hero with less spells.
please test.
i dont know. i should go to bed but this is too fucking funny.
what happens when he uses lift and you try to steal it?
its gotta get patched out but thats fucking funny.

wait what?
if you use lotus orb and rubick spell steals you, you spell steal his spell steal.
playing against bristle with him was the least fun.
yes? dont pick huskar.
no? pick huskar.
do they have physical damage?
i think huskar is always gonna be situational.
I think huskar is going to be shown more too.
just spent like ten minutes kicking a centaur around the map. tusk new batrider confirmed.
get some mobility items and he can disrupt fights.
Gotcha.
12 seconds for both punch and kick.
Without wtf mode?
hitmonchan + hitmonlee confirmed.
i think if you really practice with tusk he could be a very good high skill hero.
Is there a cool down on it?
actually thats a legit point... blink punch kick.
you can get someone out of position.
need to be able to kick allies so you can go no-boots medusa and kick her into battle.
i mean its a batrider situation.
it does zero damage, but stuns through BKB.... this is useless but fucking hilarious.

Can doom devour mud golems?
Wait.
haven't seen an effective alch yet in any of these matches ive watched.
counters bkb.
true.
And shuts down a whole team.
Disruptor aghs is so good but hard to get.
Dirtiest combo.
Disruptor, alch, and Zeus.
luna aghs.
maybe like aghs for a sven?
Position 0 alch.
truth.
i think the biggest parts are (1) aghs for supports who can't farm, and (2) aghs for carries who want the slot back.
sd?
tree, bane.
which heroes could never farm aghs usually.
12 min bane aghs?
12 minute witch doctor aghs.
yeah with the right heros around him that could be good.
the early aghs could be so gamebreaking.
it at the very least needs to be tried.
i think there's a legitmate case to be made for position 1 support alch.
or any other hero.
or offlane cent.
neither does your offlane clock.
mid tiny doesnt have to farm aghs.
new golem camp = 6 last hits for alch.
support position one alch.
jesus.
strat: protect alch for 4 minutes, let him get midas + treads, then let someone else take safelane and farm. alch farms aghs for everyone with fat stacked camps. can you imagine a 12 minute tree aghs?
if he copies techies do his mines stay up?
if morph copies a tree with aghs, do his trees stay up after he becomes normal again?
ez 400 gold bounty rune.

played zeus with oct core + aghs + refresher in bot match. WTF this hero???? 4.5s 350dmg nuke.
tiny is a great example.
its gonna be good on a support/utility alch to help out heros who are item slot starved and dont want to have to buy aghs.
10 min go.
Necro mid rushes Dagon and gets aghs from alch.
Is he rushes aghs and gives it to tiny or someone.
It's still pretty cool.
Yea.
i didnt realize that.
he cant keep getting stats.
ok, alchs thing only works once per hero.
Stu for president.
Lifestealer .
Yes.
did you download the test patch?
Which seems to be maxed out.
From my initial testing you can get alch to be at 0.17 second per attack.

Yeah Jon, not just someone, but everyone.
He can also just eat it for stats.
Everyone.
Cool that now you can remove chilling touch by clicking the buff above your health bar.
DIdnt see the alch aghs until now. I don't understand. He's basically buying an aghs for someone?
Because no one would check that shit.
So we will never know.
i assume there will be a buff indicator.
Maybe they'll get an icon or something above them.
when lion fingers 5 of them at once.
10/10 reference.
When alch applies aghs to a hero, how will the other team know?
Bears. Beats. Battlestar Galatica.
I think I'm in love with Ursa.
 Question .
sing is talking about the Ursa shit.
I think aghs is great on her, but still the nerf doesn't really do that much cause you can get up close with euls.
we'll see how it plays out.
i'm very happy with the patch so far.
lina, the one broken hero i play got only a small nerf to aghs which was an item i dont like building on her anyway.
Big nerfs to jug.
yeah: sniper, troll, jugg, storm, axe.
Ho ho ha ha!
The heroes I wanted got the nerfs they deserved I think.
It is the dawn of a new game.
I want that in my life.
Cent is so great now.
Mike, you should also do the walrus kick now.
he is a lot of fun.
i play him sometimes.
Someone should play him.
he does so much dps.
he will be unkillable.
i was just thining that jon.
Yeah, if theres ever a time for someone to try and make Leshrac a thing. It's now.
(glowballs).
You could have a 4 caster line-up and be completely gucci.
huskar still nerfed :(.
Dunno why they haven't tried to give more physical damage heroes more weight.
I think you could keep 2-3 creeps stacked with ult.
Clinkz*.
Or on clinks.
10 s cool down on ult.
Octarine on alch .
Its a casters buff update.
Mines EVERYWHERE.
AND KOTL.
dont ever speak those words again.
Techies octarine orb aghs.
techies is going to be meta with that chance. promise it.
shits gonna get out of control.
but if you have a 50+ min game.
"oh did you want this lane of rax? no, this is my lane of rax".
i think the changes to normal games are gonna be minimal.
late game dota is gonna be nuts.
Incoming 500 minute games.
Techies aghs makes base defense so crazy.
luna aghs upgrade is fucking tits.
wait no skaddi from side shop. nvm.
idk if yall talked about this, but lone druid aghs upgrade makes him the rat lord of all rat lords.
(moreso AM really jon).
Big nerf to scythe. No longer has break.
you can get a Skaadi straight from the side shop.
side shop*.
as a PA player.
you know how nice thats gonna fucking be.
omg voidstone in the sideshow.
holy fucking nuts, can you imagine that + supportphling?
things of note: KOTL cooldown reduction BORDERLINE FUCKIGN IMBA.
just caster's buff.
"have you ever seen someone come to a fight with a fucking mango???".
sing sing: "a support comes into a fight and spoon feeds a zeus a mango".
And buff supports.
New meta is attack speed.
YOU GET A LIKE YOU GET A LIKE YOU GET A LIKE.
FUCK i was playing dota while yall were chatting about doto. 1000 messages.
Yeah octane orbs are retarded. Everyone is gonna be building that shit.
Ez fuckin jungle.
Octarine enigma. Black hole every 2 mins.
The TP is what you've always wanted.
Golums can be marched. You can TP to heroes.
Yeah Brian. The Tinker game should be stronger now.
As Bloodseeker you went 18:2:3 with 676 GPM finishing at level 24

#last holy balls troll + bloodseeker.
Euls got nerf'd.
I'm playing tinker every game w this update.
Yeah the changes to quelling blade is big.
Jon don't deny our friendship.
yes.
Did he sUN? #yesorno.
NEVER.
I never liked you matt.
Sings pretty annoying IMO.
Nope. Iceiceice hands down. Dude is hilarious.
Pretty sure if I could have any pro dota player as my friend it'd be sing sing.
http://www.twitch.tv/sing_sing.
Now I'm sitting at a fucking 7-11 listening to sing. What is this updating doing to the world.
He's top streamer on dota right now.
Excited to hear his reaction about the moon glave shit.
Link.
His reaction about lotus is exactly mine.
Watching. 
watching sings reaction now.
yeah a bunch are reading it on stream.
Any twitchers casting about it yet Andy?
then esl frankfurt.
the summit will be the first big tournament with the new patch.
Just sat in this garage for like an hour .
Bet there's a lot of revisions along the way. They had to have fucked up somewhere .
Yeah. A lot to introduce before the international.
i dont even understand dota.
and all these consumable items.
the new boots though.
Expensive for a support though: 4050. The pieces are nice. Perseverance rings are so nice.
And the mana regen is sick.
You can echo so much cool shit. Imagine lotus-ing a Laguna blade, doom, finger etc.
wtf.
these new items are nuts.
You could fuck over a doom so hard. Just mirror the doom. 
Looks like a sick skill item. 
The echo is crazy.
lotus orb looks ntus.
You could just yolo into rosh so hard from the dire side.
You can erase their jungle if you spread out property.
And you can go over cliffs? Hilarious.
Centaur aghs is crazy. Damage reduction and you can run over trees. We surprise buttseks a team so hard. 
I wanted to attend that.
Sty is going to 'Stomp Some Scrubs'.
Andy Esposito is not going to 'Stomp Some Scrubs'.
Sty created event 'Stomp Some Scrubs' https://s.groupme.com/7qKsybZu.
Disrespectfully of course.
Someday I see myself hilariously building a refresher on him. Gonna yolo so hard.
Yeah the cooldown is interesting. 
go ham.
wait to respawn.
die in the middle of their team.
Dawn of the Junglers/Supps/GlowBalls.
save it for aeigis respawn.
more late game.
I like it and seems balanced.
and long cooldown.
4 sec duration tho.
He already eats nubs for breakfast. Now its gonna be for lunch dinner and elevensies. 
Pretty sure Ursa is gonna pub stomp harder than you've ever seen before.
i want to like stus comment more times.
watching sing read the patchnotes.
Tusk = Captain Falcon.
and yeah the new ursa ult looks broken as shit.
Tusk officially clowniest hero.
lol at walrus kick.
80%??? I'm sorry were you hitting me???
That's crazy isn't it?
Ursa goes into a frenzy, causing him to take 80% less damage from any source and for his attacks to deal 2/2.5/3 times the Fury Swipes damage. Removes any existing debuffs upon cast.
I think I'm gonna be playing more ursa now. I think the new ult is crazy. 
literally all the strenght.
I like the rasta buff.
Every jungler ever does.
Makes playing SK and enigma easier. 
I like that mud golums aren't spell resistant anymore. 
New disrespect: buy basher on troll and void when winning.
ooo yeah the fuck'em. Never loved them. 
Itd just be a very strange damage item for him.
Bash doesn't proc though.
Troll can buy basher now.
i keep checking the url to make sure this isnt a prank.
Is that more crazy than you can EAT THEM.
The amount of times I've missed a ward 10 times then gotten Pudge hooked and killed.
YOU NO LONGER MISS ATTACKING WARDS UPHILL.
Valve is high. 
until you kills a hero and get GIANT TREES.
omg you can eat wards with tangos.
Guys. Glowballs wins TI5.
Ez farm.
Just send them all into jungle.
the np aghs i think might be bad because it could feed treents.
Quelling blade OP too. New build for battlefury. 
how many times are people gonna fuck up the new ward system too.
Octarine core on everyone in glowballs.
New boots of travel makes Tinker cooler again. 
glow balls is BACK.
Fuckin nuts.
Octarine core is nuts.
It's a hefty price to skip aghs and refresher.
AND IT DEDUCES COOLDOWNS BY 25%???
trees EVERYWHERE.
and hilarious.
furion aghs is also awesome.
He has to get the item first though.
i dont know what to believe anymore.
Reeling on this fucking spell lifesteal on Zeus. That seems so fucking stupid.
alch is going to be op.
Guys. TI5 is going to be wack.
I like enchanted mango.
Yeah Zeus lifesteals on fucking ult? How is that fair?
Solar crest is sweet. 
Zeus Octarine core is OP as hell.
I like it.
Octarine core will be core on all carry casters.
Shards can be a 4300 gold consumable. Hilarious. 
2 tombstones.
things that would be broken for the new morphling: undyings tombstone.
ez.
+240 attack speed.
farm 4.
for alch.
Moon shard is interesting. You can fucking eat it. 
Guardian greaves are sweet.
I'm sitting in a fuckin parking lot reading these updates. Need the info now.
New levels of us doing "shh shhh shhhh".
Radiance Burn now causes affected enemies to have a 17% miss rate.
Probably.
wait so can someone hide in lifestealer, and then lifestealer infests?
Pretty sure its baller.
The Ursa rework is interesting.
support OP.
teleport allioes.
upgrade BoTs too.
Biggest change, tangos eat wards and heal for double "because wards taste better".
The lifestealer aghs is hilarious. "Eat me! Eat me!".
Alch buff.
can consume too.
moon shard +120 attack s[eed.
items are coolio too.
also WK aghs.
These new items are interesting.
cast on any ally.
weaver aghs cool too.
Our world devoured aghs is sweet.
fuck that hero.
idk.
maybe.
at least when you see the sign you can just avoid it.
You might as well just quit dota.
ursa rework.
yeah fuck that hero.
If you hated techies now.
Andy.
io double click goes to fountain. no more relocating brian 2 feet away from where he was in the same fight.
On invoked.

deafening blast is now a donut.
TREES EVERYWHERE.
LOL.
Techies Aghanim's Scepter upgrade now causes the Minefield Sign to make all Land Mines, Stasis Traps and Remote Mines within 125 area of effect immune to True Sight. Can only have one sign out at a time.
Omg prophets aghs upgrade.
Naga aghs now heals 6% every second over 7 seconds .
Yea morphlings aghs.
And morphs new aghs upgrade da fucj.
Omniknight buff.
LD aghs is gonna be crazy.

also LD.
A friend of mine visited Valve today. They have him a giant inflatable Axe. 
lifestealer aghs is super neat.
Duel lasts until either legion commander or her target dies.
Omg.
Legion aghs.
cool guys dont look at explosions.
Lookout.
Kinka no longer turns to torrent, uh oh.
Chakra Magic now adds a buff that that reduces the cooldown of the next spell its target casts by 1/2/3/4 seconds. Buff lasts 12 seconds.
omg that's cool.
if you are playing against spec or naga you can see how close they are to rad.
So this is the update hm.
that seems like a big deal.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/giphygifs/media/GOycLkSnWR0L6/giphy.gif.
#gif one for you and one for you.
track now shows current gold.
6.84 you get and aghs you get and aghs and you get an aghs.
Incoming damage reduction.
Incoming damage and free movement.
cent aghs upgrade is sweet too.
Haven't even gotten to the new items yet.
My computer saw 6.84 changes and crashed.
Had a power surge don't que.
Incapacitating Bite is no longer a Unique Attack Attack Modifier.
*2nd.
and thats the first hero.
my mind is blown.
he gets infinite stats eventuallY?
super cool.
he farms for all his supports?
Alchemist can now cast Aghanim's Scepter to directly grant any allied hero all Aghanim's Scepter bonuses as a buff (the hero upgrade and the stat upgrade). The scepter is consumed in the process. Multiple instances of this buff do not stack. Alchemist can target himself as well.
wtf is that shit.
why did you not mention the alch aghs upgrade.
I CLICKED THE GODDAMN BLINK YOU SON OF A BITCH.
Yes Andy blame it on that.

they fixed the turning and blinking issue.

What do you MEAN Cersei isn't fake? She faked her love for Robert Baratheon and also faked that he fathered her children. Her and Jamie faked to her father the whole time that they were just regular siblings and not butt buddies. She faked to Sansa that she'd be safe in Kings Landing. Faked to Ned Stark that he'd be safe. She's as fake as they come.

god fucking damnit andy.
who Dan? yeah probably.
Or maybe he was just horny.
It's okay Brian. We're all friends here now.
I heard thats good luck stu.
Brian bought condoms for his boyfriend. Who happens to be Dan. We've kept his secret by calling him Danielle.
Unicorn jizzed on mah car.
Was just at Walmart. Bought condoms and a protein bar. Chick was like da fuck?!
You just couldnt handle my superstar talent.
should have tried harder to dumb it down, we still didnt understand shit.
Or maybe the best one :).
You would make an awful rape victim andy. "dont remember it so it didn't happen".
I was probably just having to dumb it down for you.
andy you were batting 0.500 on lyrics, but definitely hitting an 11 on volume.
Everyone is on fucking Fire today. Once of the best days of GroupMe.
I dont remember it so it didnt happen.
andy i've heard you try to sing along to lupe fiasco while drunk, you dont even know all the words.
nvm desktop version messing with me.

HEY.
Sounds like something Tobias would say.
idk "Jon Gabriel" is up there.
The comic series that's from, Boy Commando's, has to be one of the worst names i've ever heard.
it actually says that in the article. Only his feet remained.
He dies when someone shot him so many times with a shotgun all that remained was his feet.
Why the fuck does Quilt-man have to "kidnap" a surgeon to try and help his vision.
classic woody thing to do, though.
Thats some dark shit.
Mike, that villain was killed, returned as a ghost to cause his cousin to miscarry so he could possess the dead baby.
This quiltman villain is so fucking bad.
aka Buckles.
woody would be http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abattoir_(comics) because he likes marrow.
http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Buckle_the_Mountain_Man.
Everyone knows this is why Matt is Buckles.
Everyone look out he might smoke some weird flower then try to turn eveyones water into a super drug to scare people.
Matt would be some sort of weird villain who only uses buckles.
LOL.
Woody would be knight rider .
ENOUGH.
HEY.
Your def a Ras-al-goul because your plans suck.
jon would be clayface because he has an ugly face.
Bored in class. Gonna read this whole crazy quilt wiki article now.
Also, quilt don't come with background checks.
Who needs batman when you can just get a gun.
Jon, have you seen how crazy that quilt is?
It looks like a shitty knock off version of scare crow.
batman doesnt kill.
I never understood why you couldn't just shoot someone like that with a gun.
O . o.
Maybe he's the normal universe Hitler and we have the alternate Crazy Quilt.
alternate universe hitler?
> Crazy-Quilt is a noted painter who leads a double-life as a master criminal.
"Crazy-Quilt has a helmet that allows him to hypnotize his victims using flashing lights of various colors. It can also project lethal laser beams, blinding lights, and functions as artificial eyes since his own eyes no longer function; the lenses feed their input signal straight into his brain.".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Quilt.
After some research i've decided I would be "Crazy Quilt".
matt would def be mr freeze, because, well, Canada.
If we're choosing anyone they'd like to be, I'd like to continue to be Omniknight.
i feel like andy would be the riddler, especially if he had a mild psychotic break. he nearly always speaks in puns already. if you give him a reason to be super evil, he'd just have evils puns. ez supervillain.
Can I be Harley Quinn .
I would like to be Ras-al-goul instead of the Riddler.
Sexy.
Woody would Poison Ivy or whatever that chicks name is.
Drago is two face. ez.
Andy is classic Scarecrow.
Brian would be Mr. Freeze.
would be Stu.
Pete and repeat are sitting on a bench. Pete fell off who is left.
Penguin.
Mike would be the Joker.
Jon is the riddler.
but then again who knows, maybe that means a lot of dota tonight.
no dota tonight.
Either way, fun 3v3s tonight me thinks.
get the fuck out of here andy.
3v3 kotl would be a very manared game.
kotl take mana :(.
3v3 kotl mana leak only.
and can only buy radiance.
only aura and other passive, no rightclicking.
3v3 necro only level the aura.
you mean 3 v. 3 Freestyle Basketball 2?
So are we doing 3v3 venomancer only, plague wards only game tonight?

most likely you have jacked it to a similar porn plot as well.
Also do you have pics of this spanish teacher. If not creep. Pls. For science.
what the hell is wrong with me.
whats weird was I wasn't grossed out by Mike's jacking it comment but was definitely grossed out by woody's snuggling-porn comment.
there's like snuggling brothels even.
They definitely do. 
Do they make snuggling porn? I could have been the star.
but it had the most sex...
I can assure my college life was likely the least porn like of everyones. I was in a happy relationship the entire time....
She gave you a B..... j right.
Not to be weird but I've definitely jacked it to a similar plot line.
this is definitely a porn.
but then she gave me a B anyway.
I decided to just get a C.
I didn't go not because she was weird but because I was lazy and didn't want to extra credit.
D+.
So instead of her giving you a C, you'd give her the D?
I didn't think of the hitting on aspect until like 2 months later.
I asked if I could make up the missed classes somehow, extra credit came up, this is when her house came up.
She said that each missed class over the 3 was a 3% deduction off my final grade, which was going to move me from a B to a C.
Met with her after class to discuss impact of absences.
Ok, so.

^thats what Woody's Spanish teacher longed to say.
My god thats good stuff ^.
This letter to Ariana grande isn't going to write itself!
I'm at half mast over here.
Who wanted the Wood-D.
Woody grow up and tell us about your hot Spanish teacher.
Texting and meeting is dangerous. 
I'm literally in a 1 on 1 meeting, Iits hard to tell a story and listen at the same time.

you can't leave like that.
oh come the fuck on.
story to be continued, need to do a work thing.
I didn't realise woody was so dangerous.
so I went and talked to her about it.
putas*.
bitches love bad boys.
The old "morning wood".
I had like 5.
You are allowed 2 (3?) absenses.
bitches love early class.
Spanish. 9am Class.
She wanted your penis. 
k. now acknowledge my request.
2 Years later when I was donating blood she approached me and gave me a massive hug. I had 0 idea who she was but talked to her for about 5 minutes on how I was doing.
wait more woody. context and more dialogue.
Also I like that (1) was fuck Spanish, (2) was erika.
She said there would be wine, I'm not even kidding.
Woody that is like mike-level of not knowing someone is hitting on you.
but she did invite me to her house once.
and I'm 99% sure she also didn't have a thing for me.
I once had a Spanish teacher who I think had a thing for me. I never acted it on it cause fuck Spanish and you know, I'm in love with Erika.
*love, whatever.
Gotta hate getting raw dogged.
She worked me like a dog though but I didn't mind.
My honours supervisor in my undergrad was hot.
I wonder how much more attention i'd pay if a smokin hot chick was teaching.
Has anyone ever had a hot teacher before.
In class, teacher said "get good information". All I heard was "get good" in dota lingo.
and they won.
zeus suicided with bloodstone with io tethered to pa and he was healed up fully.
I would be interested to see that number too.
I would assume so.
and is part of the cut Valve is taking going to go towards the original game makers?
also Secret just had a gnarly team fight.
it's k.

How unfair is 75%. Aren't they the platform for how anything anyone makes possible.
The closest I've ever been to buying DLC was for Bioshock Infinite.
So that's a thing to be mad about.
Apparently steam takes  75% cut.
Also I would never buy and DLC or mod content anyway though.
Yeah I dont understand what theres to be upset about.

It might not be beastiality, but it is definitely bestiality.
Or does bestiality require a significant difference in intelligence?
Does cross species sex count as bestiality? Because if so then daycare breeding definitely counts.

Dota is best when you hate the hero you're playing as. Everyone has to play the hero they think is shittiest. Matt plays bounty hunter, Stu pudge.

i hope they scanned your head ; you might have a concussion.
Yeah but I was drunk the whole time. i.e magical damage. i.e repel .
No GA.
But you dove facefirst in to concrete and took physical damage.
ez. Am omniknight. 
Well since I didn't get in trouble. Looks like I used GUARDIAN ANGEL .
no.
sUN, is Jon omniknight? #yesorno.
Omniknight wouldn't have bitched out like that.
Jon...
I think at that point I started throwing up on myself. Ez hospital. Ez help. 
Police were like, that dude is probably hella hammered. In my mind I bet I was like, heart of a champion. Ez. 
Apparently I split a handle of vodka with my boy. Went with them and threw a football at the tailgate. I dove for a overthrown ball head first into concrete.
So I was like, you know who I am? They were like yeah we were with you last homecoming. Dumbfounded to any knowledge of last year I was like, what happened???
Jon pls continue.
http://i.imgur.com/Owv6lf0.gifv.
woody remember those shopping cart bets we used to make?
So the following year I went to a football tailgate and two girls came to me and was like, you're that guy. I was like wtf. 
I feel like that gets highly abused.
Ez. Fucking. Drunk. Move.
They have an amnesty policy that if you ask for help you can't get in trouble .
UD didn't charge me or reprimand me for shit. Mad respect UD.
But then you have to pay 450$ so its an expensive bed and breakfast.
In the drunk tank here though you get banana bread and tea in the morning so its not bad!
Never done the hospital thing. Hope I don't have to.
And Jon I've done the hospital thing. Probably one of the worst days of my life. 
You won't.
Walked by a gaming bar and considered going in and drunk doto but I feel like there are better things I could do here.
I'm digging it.
matt your life sounds pretty sweet right now.
Just saw a CRAZY good band.
I'm hammered and have to catch a flight in 5.5 hrs.
It's my last night in europe.
Also I'm drinking heavily. 
Ezzzz.
Not only that. My dad is a surgeon at the hospital so all the doctors and nurses know me. So I woke up to even more embarrassment. Yolo.

Imagine closing your eyes and waking up with an IV and nurses looking at you.
I went to the hospital once after drinking. ez fucking mid. 
Lol.
I bet you didn't buy a house.
Remember that time you got hammered a made a mistake?
Erika and I are drunk and put an offer on a house .
Well there's your problem.

An extra warhammer on the other arm.
He carries around like a 100kg warhammer, how much more weight does he need to lift?
The buff is the extra move. Also they'll make his character look like he lifts more weights.
Warlock keeps quietly getting buffed, I hope he gets another one.
Except the timeless +1 armor.
I don't think they'll buff him.
Omniknight buff incoming. Extra move: insert balls into other teams mothers mouths. 
shit, far from JD.
but memphis is so far from memphis too.
there are lots of those here.

Met a guy from Memphis last night. He was really cocky and kind of a jerk and was like bragging about how hard core he is cause he's from apparently a dangerous city. He was hitting on a girl and wanted my opinion on Jack Daniels because according to him its way better than any whiskeys you'd find in Europe (dumbass). Told him it tastes like piss and he got really offended and the girl started laughing at him.

I'm a dirty Phoenix .
I feel like that fits your style kind of.
Once. Could be solid.
Have you played Phoenix?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D1hspM5tLs.
And slasher just came out with a guide for him if you wanna watch it.
Leshrac is sick.
You need someone with a get away move that no one plays.
I need a knew verity master. What hero does no one play? Leshrac?
He is less flashy than omni but a lot of utility thanks to the shield debuff.
its seem like its a variation of omniknight. ive never really payed any attention to abaddons.
I also like that he has a ton of salt. My kind of player. "Drow can you stop being a fucking vegetable".
I dont like that his twitch chat is making fun of his weight.
its like that and tree.
yeah abbadon is one of ppds best heroes.
Yeah, he's good. Are you watching it.
lol, watching ppds stream?
I wanna try playing abbadon .
what! Mike! Nice!
I like Jon.
I like secret.
Watching ppd's stream now. Going off on how good Secret is. 
and i do feel a bit vindicated.
though i did love the offbane.

since it also does damage, can we safely say that euls OP?
who knew.
I just found out that euls dispells flame guard.
i figured, just was curious how much programming knowledge would go into it.
0. Making something functional would be a full time side project for someone very capable. 
i think my ideal game would be like skyrim but with pokemon.
if you get involved on the pokemon rom subreddit lots of people collaborate on that.
FucksNotFoundException.
i want to create a custom pokemon game. mike and woody, on a range from ez to laboratory dog, how capable are you guys of programming that?
I re watched the Warcraft episode and got sad because the stuff they were saying made a lot of sense. "I can't; I'm stacking sunder armor".

Hero not found.
#best game .
Hello Kitty Adventure, Pink Edition.
#worst game.
Hello Kitty Island Adventure for me.
Neopets.
Pokemon? Such try hard.
Shit was mega disrespect.
I'd send him out first, normally would be up against a like level 100 charizard, he'd attack me, I wouldn't die, eat berry, go back to full HP. Then I'd poison him with toxic, refresh my berry, and watch these level 100 pokemon die to a level 1 magnemite.
and it was really strong.
idk remember exactly but it got passed to some evolution of evee.
it ups special attack a shit ton i think.
whats that one move that the firey butterfly has?
Man, so I had a level 1 magnemite with sturdy (so he couldn't die) a move that restored whatever berry you had (I gave him the berry that would restore like 30hp, so it'd bring him back to full health) and toxic.
i played against some baton pass ones and i'm pretty sure i lost most.
Pokerus and all that jazz.
I have a friend who has a completed pokedex and ev trained the fuck out of his team .
Yeah baton pass teams were stupid.
Did you see the guy who had a team with a bunch of baton passes and made an op magikarp.
that game taught me how little i knew about competitive pokemon.
https://www.delugerpg.com/.
I played this a little .
Yeah Andy, there were a few games like it I think.
because if so then yes.
It was super competitive, and you'd see some really cool teams.
where you can just pick any lineup you want and fight poeople?
Roms *.
It's this free online game where you create any pokemon team and then play online against other people's.
I played Roma.
is that the online poke  battle thing?

Mines Articuno.
your character would have skills too, like being able to catch pokemon, or craft items.
Fav Pokémon: go.
I've been wanting that my whole life.
i would give so much money for that.
Snorlax used to be op too.
i wish they would come out with an rpg game based on pokemon.
And Lugia was pretty annoying.
Entei fucking up peoples days.

You couldn't attack your opponents, you could only throw pokeballs.
Me and my friends used to have pokemon matches where we put items on Max and only had pokeballs as the spawning item.
The beginnings of who we are today .
it did 1 damage, and i always thought that would be the most disrepectful way to kill someone.
in the n64 smash then only taunt that did damage was luigi's kick.

My cousin was such a good Wolf and would use that stupid fuxking howl taunt whenever he killed me.
The only time I've ever rage quitted a game is in Brawl.
EZ mid.
Dedede, throw spiked mystery thing, jump in the air to butt slam. Hammer smash finish.
his up smash was absurd.
jon will agree with me when i say that lucas was the shit.
Pika-fire, baseball bat to the face, ez yoyo for disrespect.
olimar was terrible.

Nah it has to stun.
Remember in Brawl when they added that stupid trip mechanic?
make it a silence instead of a stun?

yeah matt, know your justices.
lol found the canukc.
Also, I can see them increasing the CD on trolls ult. Shit is stupid low.
Who's alito?
pretty sure alito hasn't weighed in on a shrapnel nerf yet.
Unless they reduce the health cost.
Even if huskar gets buffed that will mean that AA will get picked / banned in every game.
not positive but i think there was a supreme court case.
I can see a shrapnel nerf incoming, they either reduce the AOE or increase cooldown.
i'm fairly certain that even given the laws on the books, the only crimes punishable by death are murder.
Hearts for everyone.
"because I successfully argued my way out of that relationship" lol.
Actually it may be porcupine.
You also can't have sex with a hedgehog.

808s was where he started to get darker, rhymes less wholesome and positive .
i agree with jon on kanye.
a live action rendition of the coldest winter music video.

but.
how much would you pay for 808s and heartbreaks?

FALCON PUNCH!!!!
i think it was a-up, jump, a-down and then sleep.
in 64 captain falcon was my favorite.
it did so much damage.
she was good if you could nail the fall asleep move.
^^ and it bounces off walls and stuff.
A skill shot rune like a green shell would be so sick.
best disrespectul play was getting really good at jigglypuff, nobody ever expects the puff.
where i stand a mile away and blow people up with my zelda fireballs.
i want wii version.
i take pride in that.
you're too good at that game.
no, its not fun playing with you.
smash64?
actually no, i want to play smash.
i kinda just want to play mario kart now.
he's a chain chomp not a philosopher.
I enjoy where my retarded random cheese idea took us.
*wandering.
also a wondering chain chomp.
and they can't jump that fucking gap so you win the race.
If you trample them with Centaur ult they get flattened.
And very tiny.
a zeus ult rune that also makes everyone on the other team weaker for a short period of time.
A star rune gives 300% attack damage, 50% speed and invulnerable.
LOL andy spot on.
and fake runes that explode.
also bananas to make the other heros slip.
Runes that did burst speed like mushrooms in mario kart would be hilarious.
waits outside of pucks phase shift.
like the blue shell cant be disjointed.
Only targets the top networth hero on the other team.
mario kart blue shell cheese: one targetable bkb-piercing stun.
Also makes the game hilarious.
Gives incentive for turtles to leave the shell / quicker games.
Would make fighting at roshan more epic later in the game.
basically just make the cheese a better version of a rune: haste cheese, DD cheese, normal cheese is just a better regen rune.
rng cheese would be awesome.

also BH.
i dont entirely understand how undying or his aghs ulty work so i cannot comment.
> twombstones.
zombies around ulted undyingg?
2 tombstones?
what will it be.
undyign aghs buff.
i still love jakrio. if i can get a decently timed euls ez game.
remember when jakiro and sb were the meta?
"why when i was a child, there was a parade every day. those were dark times....".
remember that time when there was an ogre in every game? those were fun times.
ult orb is probably the right choice. stacking stats seems to be meta.
Thats more important.
Nerf to aghs though.
Although recipe again.
im ok with that.
Nerf to bloodstone.
But yeah sheep will still be more.
how about increase cost of point booster?
They could fix linkens by adjusting recipe cost.
when a mommy linkens loves a daddy linkens.
how do you make a linkens?
wait.
and Linkens.
that nerfs sheep too i guess.
Make ultimate orbs cost more. Nerf to all agi heroes.
1/2 slow through bkb?
the slow will be nerfed.
I think skadi will also be nerfed.
his AGI gain is stupid.
And he benefits a lot from that.
The extra agi is nice though.
definitely.
i dont like the change they made to diffusal where level 2 burns less mana, i thought that was a PL nerf.
Aghs pl makes it so that every attack on a hero has a 100% chance of giving another illusion.
illusions deal pure damage.
+1 armor.
what would be a sweet ass pl buff?
my prediction is fucked ever since they changed him around.
global sniper ulty.
riki aghs buff incoming.
what new aghs buffs will we see.
more important.
ez unkillable.
woody: buy a euls or bkb.
maybe LD and lc too.
He's awesome against slow, which Stu says is the current meta. I don't think he's OP. Any silence fucks him up and he is super dependant on magical damage.
Ds is too weak right now.
I'm talking 1.
but as a 3 or 4.
NS is already meta.
ns and ds too.
i remember the lina game i played where the slark went skadi + satanic because he was so tired of laguna blade.
Lol, i doubt it stu but i hope you're right.
also core kotl.
I don't think Storm is as strong as everyone thinks.
nd riki.
and pl.
CK.
Obviously lina is good.
Yeah i think storm is really strong right now.
Seriously though storm spirit meta incoming.
She's balanced tho, qop.
melee tanks.
But as a result of his nerf, heros he countered became strong.
and tanks.
basically ranged int carries.
I see her in way more games.
QoP seems to be getting way popular.
I know he wasnt popular because he countered them, that wasnt my point.
Huskar meta incomong.
we back boyz.
STRENGTH CARRIES.
Razor wasn't popular because he countered them. He was a pusher with aghs.
Somewhere around the massive EXP swing.
Ok so lets make some predictions. I think that one of the reasons troll and jugg got so popular is because razor, a hero that was popular before, countered them but then got nerfed. What heros do sniper, troll and jugg counter who will be popular after they all get nerfed?
It was this game, http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1394525120.
Fv isn't a great manfighter outside of chrono. But yes this is the phase s&y skadi meta.
I hope I'm describing it right, I can find the game.
Sounds hilarious.
Yeah no debate troll needs nerf. I'd like to watch that moment you're referencing.
Yeah, its kinda nuts.
That's too strong.
My point is even with BkB and 25% miss chance, troll can perma stun a farmed carry with no help or good items.
especially without a MKB.
Bash doesn't give a shit about your items if you just stand there trying to hit him.
That I once was crushing as faceless, Daedalus, molihnir, BkB, mask of madness. 1 on 1 against troll who only had MoM and HoD. I was a few levels up. I popped BkB and fought him and got crushed. I was too mad.
I can see it.
it gives the illusion of a chance.
and to me getting obnoxiously slwoed is worse than a stun.
because of the meta skadi is always in games.
but actually it's the amount of slow.
meh.
the fact that I only have fun in AD now.
Whats the most annoying thing about this patch?
26th. How much more must we endure. HOW MUCH MORE. kidding I actually don't care that much.

Woah Murfreesboro got ranked #84 best city to live in! That's pretty good. Not as good as Charlottesvilles #1, but pretty good.
People are good.
People actually live there, which would be refreshing .
Murfreesboro is nice.
Really?
Murfreesboro, not an apartment of sin. Well maybe both.
My family is from there!
Fine, living in an apartment of sin.
And moving to Murfreesboro, where we know no one there.
It's easier for us since we would just be in an apartment .
Lol.
Living in a house of sin more like.
If we live together I could actually be moving about an hour away.
On the one hand less travel time .
Well fuck you.
Dota time uncertain.
Living together likely.

our team would lose, then I would saunter over and get triple kills and take towers.
and I would be farming.
there were a few times there would be team fights.
but it was 1441 on their whole team so that works.
my biggest hit that game was only 1441 :/.

Centaurs ez hp.
Clinkz ult is so dang good. Only 10 seconds of down time.
you were probably better off with clinkz? still a sweet chunk of damage, and because it's base damage the venge aura amped it.
I tried to get nyx ult but some dweeb on my team took it.
that wasn't an option.
yea.
getting brian's enchant totem + tidebringer would be devastating in a real AD game.

The answer is almost always depends.
I think silencer is easier to deal with than sniper IMO.
I think it all depends on the game. Against silencer every channeled ability sucks.
Chono aoe not much bigger.
Sniper always sits back so its hard to get him in the BH. If you get the rest of his team he sjust sits back and rekts you.
With this new sniper meta enigma kind of sucks.
Signs point to yes.
Is BH best #magic8.
But I'd put black hole at #2.
I argue that chrono is better based on its aoe and how void functions.
Is black hole the best spell in the game?
I'm following now.
-pushes up bridge of glasses-.
The dagon obviously doesnt.
I think he meant that bloodrage pierces spell immunity.
Yeah woody.
Get a job.
Dagon pierces spell immunity? My puck games disagree.
Hawrry sheet.
(and pierces spell immunity).
1.96 * dagon damage ez.
the timing is hard but the damage is stupid.
Bloodrage yourself, bloodrage target, use dagon, ez kill.
shit it is still a thing.

Dagon blademail bs used to be a thkng.
"does it work on x?" "yes, it works on x".
all damage.
(yes brain it does work).
Ok just show me what you mean tonight.
fuck hellbear smashers.
And stacking for your carry makes sense because no one is using the jungle while they are in lane.
as long as they're not fucking hellbear smashers, seeker doesnt have a very hard time past level 2 taking them.
classic brian question.
so bloodrage works on items like dagon right.
Like stacking for sk makes sense because he kills a bunch of camps just as fast as one.
Hearts for everyone.
<3.
in my eyes you are perfect mike.
the difference-maker is that if you haven't finished a camp, you can stack it before the respawn. then you don't have to run to a new camp to keep farming, which wastes time.
Thats what i thought but i could be wrong.
Stacking only makes sense if you want to take out a large amount of creeps at the same time with aoe. And bs either a) cant take out all those creeps fast enough for it to be efficient or b) can clear all the camps in the allotted time and therefore stacking doesnt make sense.
i'm not perfect at it, but i can show you the idea.
I will watch.
Ok.
you do not.
ill show you tonight.
You also get fucked by ranged creeps.
aghs refrsher zeus ulti w bloodrage = new glowballs.
Hardly worth it though since it doesnt really save you time in the beginning.
you just have to choke-point right.
Pretty much, still a good combo.
you can absolutely stack jungle and take it early with seeker.
fuck zeus using ulty would be like a starter's pistol for bloodseeker.
Yeah you dont want to do that until later.
ZOOM BITCHES.
it was more difficult.
s&y and euls bloodseeker best bloodseeker.
i made the mistakes of stacking the jungle with him though as a jungler.
Ive made a huge mistake.
hello darkness my old friend.
k. i'll play more bloodseeker. that was fun last time.
That would kill anyone.
Holy fuck.
Jon play more seeker.
lol refresher + aghs + bloodseeker lina is 2660 damage.
Thats stupid.
EVERYTHING.
Bloodraged tinker with et spirit nearby.
Or can it amp all magic damage too.
Can it only do the bloodrage on lina's ult with aghs cause its pure?
bloodrage my tinker.
(it still works on zeus just 1/2 bonus damage, so only a huge 20% boost).
Before they nerfed it some.
Yeah thats why people used to do zeus bs.
I didnt know that shit worked w other peoples spells.
Free lunches only available during deliberations not during trial.

If anyone gives a shit.
Sry I missed the lawyer question. Basically for possession of stuff you can be found guilty circumstantially so you don't have to actually posses it. Like Andy said if you had something else that links you to the possession. Also prior bad act or crimes can't be introduced bc basically he's on trial for that murder. If the prosecutors said well he shot some other guy. Jury automatically thinks well he's a violent gun shooting dude. Guilty. And that's not what the framers wanted. O'Doyle rules!
best is if the frost bounces back to ancients after killing so the trap is still there.
Also remember that.
i know i got one kill with it once, and they were super confused on the other team.
thats hilarious.
I remember that.
i _think_ that the one time I managed to farm aghs (offlich ftw) and did that to the enemy ancients, their WK immediately DC'd.
farm aghs > find other teams ancient stack > ez farm denial.
farm aghs > sick stacks > ez farm.

also i think because of how balanced dota is, it would only work in a pro game if you picked which player had to play which hero.

and wanted to roleply.
or was pirate-kin.
maybe the friend really deserved it.
Also apparently Hernandez once shot a friend in the face which caused him to lose one of his eyes however this wasn't admissible in court. Seems hyper relavant.
yea.
He was found guilty of the murder too right?
Bullets.
Go!
How can both of those be true?
However the same article reports the gun used in the murder was never recovered.
Hernandez was found guilty of illegally possessing the handgun used in the crime.
Law question (Andy/Brian).

Slarfar is shit.
Slardar counters brood so hard.
also: tinker.
but both are unfun.
i'd rather play against techies than brood because brood is more aggressive earlygame.
then you just need to check for remotes.
send a spiderling forward to disarm bombs.
i doubt it.
Techies is a good brood counter.
playing against brood can be really frustrating but its still more bearable than going against techies.
was your nightmare that game last night.
i've had nightmares that are not unsimilar to the way in which i die to broods spiderlings.
spawn-spiderlings given culling blade effect, also global.
andy auto-DC'd from game when brood is picked.
Spiderlings now spawn in multiples of two.
Allow a Max of 25 webs.
How the fuck could they buff brood?
because it would be on reddit.

jokes on you there is an update today.
i hate woody.
Yea I was lying. Anyone get excited?
New Dota 2 Update is out. MoM nerfed. http://blog.dota2.com/2015/14/sprint-update/.
i just have to make janky versions.
that looks sweet. i dont have enough cards to copy these kind of decks though.
its fun being able to steal the other sides minons.
and i played some good games against both aggro hunter warlock and ultra control warrior and freeze giant alex mage.
i like recombob preist the best i think.
Just ban silencer nub.
yeah i get some good cards that way.
true.
its very susceptible to silence .
priest is fun though, i like thoughtsteal a lot.
smart.
i spread the buffs.
yeah i assume you usually just get some huge impossible to remove minion by turn 3 or 4.
the zombie chows stalkers and the death lords with the valens chosen and power word shield are so strong early game.
1 owl too.
i run two belchers two zombie chow no sylvannas no healbot no dark cultist only one nova.
it honestly looks pretty standard for a priest deck except with 2 lightbombs, and the gilbin stalkers. i assume its really strong against aggro. what changes did you make?
my brain is struggling to compile.
or did you just stick with trying to make exodia.
did you include your blue eyes white dragon this time.
but this gives you the main idea.
i made a few changes to it.
http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/savjzs-season-12-lightbomb-control-priest/.
send me list.
andy been having success on ladder with a priest deck put together by savjz .
so if anyone has an android phone or tablet we should swap for extra packs.
just like you get a free pack for playing it on a tablet.

And can be done fast enough to avoid reaction times.
The slow from the auto att after ball lightning with the passive will slow enough to still electric vortex the enemy.
Brian the one thing in the combo with his abilities the video forgets is to attack click on the target after ball lightning the passive procs off that and the guide tells you to pretty much waste that right click and immediately electric vortex.
Just keeping busy at work.

On Friday we made Mario and Mushroom out of cans of Mushroom soup (and others).
also because he's making jokes about "like a baus".
And with the new bloodstone recipe it makes soul ring a key item.
You can see from this video that its a few years old.
idk i never play him, but i feel entitled to tell you exactly how to play him.
this build seems a little outdated. it says treads + wand+ 2x null tally. most of them do treads bottle then (soul ring to orchid to bloodstone), or just rush bloodstone.
Storm can clear stacks like a boss and it speeds up the timing on his first item (be it orchid or bloodstone).
Farm faster.
most builds recently skip vortex for a super long time now, not entirely sure why.
And I will try it out tn.

no lie im learning how to play storm spirit like a boss in a hilarious video.

we're down the rabbit hole now.
*eleven seas shut up.
I don't care if that isn't even your stupid fake name anymore.
Kevin shut up.
i'm sure you're all aware that two can be as bad as one; it's the loneliest number since the number one.
Sea of one.
A single sea man.
onesie.
one is the loneliest number for a sea.
http://i.imgur.com/thhgY.gif.
How many seas is kevin? #kobe.
except when you're wrong.
Kevin changed name to Eleven Seas.
when you're right you're right.
#rekt.
You're not pronounced eleven seas.
its not pronounced eleven-seas.
elevenses.
Something went wrong.
#gif elevensies.
yeah so still in the scope of a 2600 calorie day, a 900-1000 calorie chipotle lunch really isnt a big deal i think.
Everything else is just a tease.
Supper is best meal.
I like the food but my schedule doesnt allow for it.
"what do we always say is the most important thing?" "breakfast?" "no, family".
breakfast is the king of meals.
And even then i think thats probably lunch.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/giphygifs/media/p4pqDFU3zIQWQ/giphy.gif.
Unless im doing drunk brunch i never have breakfast.
#gif second breakfast.
lol.
11sies.
and elevenses?
How about 2nd breakfast.
Rarely will I have time to make a breakfast. Its a quick granola bar if anything.
Or a hobit?
i mean was my lunch 2 pop tarts? yes.
What am i amish?
Who eats breakfast?
we came up with words for them.
breakfast lunch dinner?
Whats weird about 2 meals.
wat.
2 meals a day.
Which is one of the many reasons why i get the bowl.
> whl eats 2 meals a day.
the tortilla is 300 calories, which is the difference.
So i still say that the place is not unhealthy.
Yeah ^.
similar to what happens when people eat more when they work out cause they think they deserve the reward so they end up gaining weight.
Still is probably fine if all you're considering is your caloric intake of the day.
The calories depend on your order. 625 is a normal meal for someone whl eats 2 meals a day.
go fuck yourselves, commies.
yeah by unhealthy i meant a ton of calories.
Christ. Heart disease in a bowl.
i'm not saying i'm not a fat person in waiting, nor am i super aggressive about eating healthy. in fact, i'm likely to eat that later today. but its delicious.
625 for mine because i'm not a dummy.
1000 calories?!
50 grams of proteins for mad gainz.
1065 calories in my regular burrito.
http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/menu/nutrition_calculator/nutrition_calculator.aspx.
Type in your ingredients you just did.
http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/menu/nutrition_calculator/nutrition_calculator.aspx.
Explain.
it... is.
Its not medicine but as far as food goes its not bad.
but it's tasty enough that i can eat the guilt away.
Yeah by no means is it healthy.
i mean its not that healthy.
The quality of ingredients is very high.
Im still curious why dragos thinks its unhealthy.
If I get a bowl I always get chips and just murder it like nachos. 
cheese and you're done.
chili powder + meat + peppers.
how? its hella easy.
And whenever i make mexican food and forget it i have regrets.
mmm.
then you just take a mouthful of warm cream.
except when it pools at the bottom.
Its solid.
Yeah sour cream and cheese are necessary. The sour cream is just the best.
Bowl -> white rice -> pinto -> chicken -> mild -> medium -> sour cream -> cheese.
brown rice + fajita veggies + chicken + mild salsa + medium salsa + cheese + sour cream.
fucking die matt.
As far as I know Chiptole doesn't exist in Atlantic Canada, so I've never had it. Is it like taco bell? That shit is poison.
Ill add those in every so often.
bitch do you even fajita veggies.
Not even unhealthy if you dont get the chips.
Burrito -> Brown Rice -> Black beans -> Steak -> Mild salsa -> Hot salsa -> Sour Cream.
therefore you are bad.
you implied its bad.
just overpriced and unhealthy.
i didnt say its bad .
You're dumb though dragos. Chipotle is good.
Oh.
I have never tried it.
The barbacoa?
barbacoa.
Are you thinking of the right place?
ill put up your picture at every chipotle across the globe.
They dont even have shrewded beef i dont think.
nope. no going back now dragos. I now forbid you for ever getting it.
i do like their shredded beef though.
YOU'RE UNHEALTHY.
just as unhealthy.
DRAGOS.
> ass what.
overpriced fast food.
LOL matt are you stupid?
I've never been.
ass what im saying.
fuck i love chipotle.
A country of me's would make Chipotle the top grossing company.
non toxic glue of course.
No Dragos. Bad.
you know what to use as adhesive right?
"dear delilah, i hate your guts".
lol k fine. tomorrow. 
Like seriously, its too funny not to send.
Jon pls mail that letter.

Who would we write to with our left hands .
what would a country full of ultra hetero jonny g's do without girls.
"Alright everyone, back in the pile!".
- 2k15.
They'd probably just be boning each other the whole time.
> what hell.
> would scild.
scold*.
i think the jonny g's would scild each other.
That place would be magical.
only if there's a bunch of dragos' there .
That sounds like hell.
i wanna visit a country inhabited by jonny g's ; i bet ill see lots of song merriment and scolding over poor dota picks.
If I see one dude duplicating himself I'll send a snapchat.
matt please confirm or deny.
Like rotifers.
however maybe estonians are just one dude multiplying through division .
as far as i know there are estonian girls out there  so sun is the one who fucked up.
I was hoping a "you should shut the hell up" would be said.

What time is it there Dragos?
doto anyone? im bored and cant sleep.
woody's hook onto my escaping spirit breaker never forget.
Support pudge saves butts. Oracles vanishes butts. Dazzle delays the inevitable. 
i remember one where dragos was dazzul and woody was oracle and they were just saving butts left and rigiht.
undying confirmed strongest hero.
not dying op.
But, Brian, you don't even have any money.
Jon I might give it to you for a big sausage pizza. There's only one problem. sUN, tell him!
their lycan could manfight the shit out of me, but the 5 seconds of non dying let me kill him.
i still loved the game where i went mid lina and dragos was dazzle.
And my body. Willing to give up my body. 
I have it.
I want a cool Earthshakers totem / wall. Willing to give up any items for one. 
In true lina fashion, but then we rekt him.
rest of his team did very little.
he rekt us early game.
He wasn't even good.
because its a boring item.
and that guy never built aghs.
lol.
Get a job.
Mike was it you that I played that game with against the guy who has like 3500 Lina games?
never fall off.
phase euls aghs skadi mkb daedalus.
If you can get through the mid game she falls off pretty hard thougg.
100% of the time worth it.
except that phase + euls + aghs makes her a miserable bitch in the midgame.
but a lot of times aghs is still worth it.
i like building rightclick on her.
i kinda hate that its good.
god fk her aghs ulty.
not much more challenging than it already can be for l-dawg.
trying to lasthit lane creeps would be challenging.
thats basically how clockwerk rocket feels sometimes.
deso first item, skip boots.
rightclick towers.
you could also rat from base.
and the ez jungling.
just sit in base and harass all lanes.
can you imagine the lane harass.
projectile speed takes forever.
yes.
would that actually be broken?
6.84 lina range global.

My favorite is when Jon and Cersei bang while Jamie watches in depression and anger.
Always takes you by surprise.
but classic r.r. martin.
i was surprised by that part in the book.
But isn't it crazy when Tyrion meets up with Arya and then he impregnates her and Daario shows up for the abortion but arya turns in to her direwolf and gets teleported to the wall where she eats all the white walkers and her and Jon Snow raise Tyrions and hers child for the rest of the series?!
we'll see though i guess.
but it looks like they may have cut out one of the big characters from book 5 based on last episode.
Yeah I'm gonna keep this spoiler free.
Hope so, way better than old Sansa .
also careful about spoliers.
i think there's gonna be some departures.
Book 6 gonna fuck some shit up. Also its interesting how Sansas story in the book has caught up to it in the show. Does this mean we'll be seeing new sansa storyline?
Also has anyone thought of getting Dish's Sling TV option, cause it sounds amazing.
Me.
me.
Who here has read the books?
Treant Protector = Hodor.
Book 6. She'll probably become riki then.
She's not one of the Faceless Men yet.
I disagree with jon I think arya is riki .
Bounty Hunter is Daario.
Abbadon is Cold Hands.
does jon eat the booty like sausage pizza #yesorno?

goddamnit mike, make the overused breathing heavy joke you son of a bitch.
ez, its because PA is a punk ass bitch.
nvm.
my previous message was deleted.
i always forget shes a girl.
mike, i think its "coming"...
Phantom Assassin might be Ary instead of PA.
i'm like sexual assault in comedy form.
i think that point is coming...
i dont stop with a joke until you're sick and tired of it, and even then i'm likely to try to keep pushing until it's funny again.
ill be weaver. fly all the way there, stay for a little then fly back before the international is done.
Wow Kevin you've already made that joke like 5 times and its still hilarious.
I have a blue morph suit so enigma would be ez.
trust me im there.
im gonna be riki.
I don't know, pugnas a little punk.
only if matt goes at Enigma.
Beard, braided hair, 5 ft hammer, the whole bit.
only invoker would be a bigger douche.
you'd have to be a huge asshole the whole time.
Jon the only way that I'll accept you're omniknight is that if you go solo to TI5 in perfect omniknight cosplay and never break character the whole time.
the joke that is.
so it speaks lies from time to time.
but i am omniknight.
The joke has spoken.

That would be a dope pick.
This has gone too far.
4 I think.
is aui pos 4 or 5?
SumaiL would be a sweet pick.
more farm.
get aui instead.
ppd is always 10th in networth.
PPD wins games, ez points.
wat.
never draft ppd.
and he'd get ROTK.
then we'd laugh.
Black^ first pick.
and andy's computer would crash but he'd have strong opinions about who he wants.
Obviously. 
the saddest part about the fantasy draft for TI5 is that ive probably watched enough dota to actually make an informed opinion about who i'd draft.
Where thou feeling it.

Especially if we were all dressed up and on video with each other.
that in fact could actually beat it.
Can we pls do another draft guys?
Except for a skype D&D session.
Still is. Not much can touch a fucking fantasy draft for professional video game players.
still think we should organize a skype D&D session.
Everyone agreed.
Remember when we did our dota fantasy draft? I remember there was a point during the Skype call that Stu (I think) said, "So, uh, is this the nerdiest thing that everyone here has done?" .
Peanut Butter and Jealous.
Peanut butter and Jelly.
U jelly.
You guys managed to merge two mega nerdy things.
We are cool guys.
Yes PL is a good call.
or phantom lancer.
Or that guy could be meepo.
That moment where the nightswatch guys hold the gate against the giant is like two supports taking on a fed carry.
Him or pugna.
Rubick is one of those guys from the Temple of the Dead who stole Dani's dragons.
Watches people walk away, hooks them in and tortures them with knives .
Pudge maybe. Because he does weird shit to people.
My favorite character in the whole series is Sam Tarley.
He's banned.
I don't like him.
meepo.
Can't think of anyone that would be Ramsay Bolton .
Kotl is that old dude who is really a boss.
Undying is a white walker.
Ned fed first blood.
Denearys gotta be like cm. and Phoenix Jakiro and viper follow her.
RIP.
Kahl Drogo is axe.

Loris Tyrell is Invoker .
Rob is lycan.
Hodor is ogre magi.
Bran is chen.
Davos had to go to the bank to pitch that if you let the antimage farm, it could indeed become the one true king of dota .
Brienne is legion.
littlefinger is techies.
Davos is kunka.
Stannis is antimage.
Lina is the fire priestess .
Egret windrunner.
Alchemist is the hound .
Axe is the mountain .
arya is TA.
If dota was game of thrones, what heroes would be who.
And thrones .
Game of who can get away with the greediest line-up .
Rekt.
Jungler + solo support Pudge .
Also that line up was so crazy greedy.

voulez vous coucher avec moi andy?
k nvm.
is that so wrong?
i value you jon.
those aren't the values you have wrong andy.
armlet and small crit still does more expected damage than just daedelous though, and armlet does more than small crit.
made some corrections because i had some values wrong.

naw the moment's ruined.
cus i'm curious what could be that bad.
...now i kinda want you to.
like, over the line mean.
man i want to say something really mean.
i'll feel really stupid if someone checks this and i'm wrong though.
numbers again andy?
there you go.

http://s3.amazonaws.com/giphygifs/media/wYnDQpKj3cABa/giphy.gif.
#gif clippy.
which is more in both cases than you do with daedelous.
and 828 when you do.
with armlet and small crit, you do 473 damage when you dont crit.
i bet he doesn't even use pivot tables.
yeah, the numbers are undeniable.
bet you he has the paperclip help tool open.
andy is a whiz at making brackets. like, rainmain-level whiz at brackets. shit is like fractal complexity.
i can send spreadsheet later.
i am using excel.
Andy Esposito: math whiz.
i bet you're using excel, plebian.
which is still cheaper than daedelous.
ight now doing math for small crit and armlet together.
l2spell nerd.
kidding I LOVE ANDY.
i know, i was comparing it to daedelous in what i was just talking about.
thats one to many people mike.
that song is super sarcastic. "andy you're a start... in nobody's eyes but mine".
i''m the man i'm the man.
jon you can tell everybody.
Andy, Armlet costs 2500 and Crystalys costs 2150.
andy is no star. andy is no man.
jon why.
andy, this is america. this is a democracy. you can say all you want about science and numbers and math, but the rest of us can watch nascar, call you gay, and vote you out of office.
mike retract that last music video.
and continue building your heros wrong.
so suck it nerds.
so you guys can hate all you want, but i was right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQtXxgAAXEk.
yeah but can it see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch.
less than half the price.
for an item that costs way less.
110 more expected damge.
armlet does 443 damage every time.
didntreadlol dot gif.
this means an expected damge of 332.
crit chance is 25%.
so here are the results: with daedelous a level 16 earthshaker does 246 damage without crit and 591 damage when he crits.
http://i.imgur.com/75dta.gif.
and you could make ample use of #haters here.
Also Andy, you're still wrong.
andy. I thought we went over this.
Everyone would have to donate a TP to a teammate. And you'd have to steal one from the enemy team.
alright, math finished, armlet is way better item.
That would take some serious coordination.
i think dagon is the rich man's insult, and soul ring is the poor man's insult.
what about 6 tps not stacked?
an entire team of 6 slotted soul ring recipes is a dream i want to fulfill .
soul ring recipe is cheapest, refresher is most expensive.
so they know.
but no dagon.
5 dagon recipes.
Null talismans? Bracers? Magic Wands?
dagon.
What is the most disrespectful recipe?
Full inventory of aghs.
and we've been looking for ways to innovate in that department.
About time.
to be honest tho a full inventory of recipes is hella disrespectful.
cant argue with that logic, i should just stop doing math.
god be more wrong andy.
See andy.
We're talking about a videogame, so no it isn't.
You may rely on it.
Are 6 armlet recipes better than an armlet? #magic8.
> Relax, you're doing fine.
this is more than ones and zeros.
what hell?
fuck you sun.
rofl.
It is decidedly so.
Is Andy wrong? #magic8.
numbers indeed.
andy whatchu got there numbers?
>what hell.
mr. armlet comes back into play.
doing the math right now, btw. armlet costs about as much as the small crit, and even when you do get a crit on that (20%) you still do less damage than you would do with armlet every time you enchant.
what hell.
yes.
sun will i like basically any message that says what hell #yesorno.

I don't think I believe you Kevin.
I didn't know that... But can you give the rapier back to your teammate?
the rapier has to go to the other team before it is a big ol skanky whore rapier.
just Jons.
yes. your ally dies with newly-purchased rapier. you pick it up. muted.
Rapiers can't be muted, right?
and 6 muted rapiers in stash.
6 muted gg branches.
^.
6 armlet recipies.
6 dusts and 5 more in the stash before armlet.
*5 gems and one aegis.
5 wards and one aegis.
and one shared tango.
5 sets of tangos before armlet.
No boots duh.
or no boots?
no blink.
5 bracers before armlet.
also more consistant than straight crit.
the cheapest way to get a lot of that is armlet.
kevin makes a good point though, earthshakers enchant totem benefits from base damage.
So can it, Kevin.
yes.
Is it related sUN? #yesorno.
wholly different beasts.
thats not related. tuskar gets a crit, shaker gets a buff to base damage.
http://i.imgur.com/SLVAdhd.png.
related.
#dulynoted.
Jon has a point.
soul ring into blink then nothing else matters cause earthshaker roolz.
similar playstyle/itemization to kunkka.
not MoM on critshaker. he's not there to manfight, he's there to explode you.
i dont have time to get into this now, because i'm at work but later i will give better thought out reasons why all of you are dumb.
I'd go basher over armlet.
I'd probably even go MoM over armlet.
shaker farms slow. have to pick the right order of items to not waste time.
every day of the week too matt.
you'd be wrong.
 Id go deso over armlet any day of the week.
and armlet is one of the most cost effective damge items in the game.
i maen i'm not saying daeldelous is bad but we're comparing different tier items.
+40 * 4, but daedalus is better.
I don't think armlet is the right pick on him.
Crit + enchant totem or whatever its called is waaaay more damage.
+40.
it buffs his damage so much.
fast blink and then armlet.
Armlet takes a while to farm.
Seriously though, critshaker needs a fast blink and then deadalus.
#rekt.
r-e-k-t rekt rekt rekt.
I still maintain you're a doofus.
yet no one who plays that hero ever believes me.
i still maintain that armlet is the correct item on critshaker.
but critshaker gets more damage from +STR to crit with?
Extra damage is spose. Although I think the extra mana from treads would be more useful.
jon curious why you went phase boots on critshaker.

there's your answer.
duck tales should be the name of the app.
Wasn't as funny as I hoped.
I met someone today who owned  he domain www.ucanpooptoo.com.
This is where I last ducked.
or something web 2.0 like dck.io.

what would the name of the app be?
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0t0ykVDMu1qzozj1.gif.
#pooping.
We can talk about it over Skype next time we're both on.
just as reliable as foursquare.
Because it gives them a "hunting journal" so to speak. Hunters love talking about the amount of stuff they shoot, and this would give them a super accurate record of their hunting endeavours.
Real talk, $200k maybe? Why would any hunter use it though?
unsanitary diapers?
#neat.
Seriously though, I feel like if you pitched this to the North American waterfowl Management Plan team you might get money for this. They have 100s of millions of USD.
also if the app works in europe, why wouldnt it work in america.
That's enough dollars.
http://i.imgur.com/eTCwx.gif.
#kobe, how many dozens of dollars do I have?
How much money you got?
@Woody Zantzinger . Serious talk here. At the conference, one of the Europeans mentioned they're developing an app so that hunters can track immediately when they shoot a bird, what species it is, and it takes their GPS locations. This would start to create a huuuge dataset on harvest records for waterfowl in Europe. How hard would an analogous app be to create for North America / USA? I can see something like this being huge for conservation.

Whisper that in her ear on the honeymoon: "this is romantic as fuck".
thats called every river matt.
I went to Severn one summer.
There's a river you can tube down and drink beer on. 
Canada in the summer is awesome.
Shits romantic as fuck.
I agree actually.
You can tell us.
Its like 100F here every day and the orchards are on bust and I live in a huge winery area.
Is she hurting you?
woodster pls.
what blackmail does she have on you.
Man Canada rules in the summer.
why are you marrying that huss then.
Erikas dream honeymoon is not somewhere cold and Dota.
http://hackaday.io/project/3723-kapcom.
this guy made a hardware interface for controlling Kerbal Space Program.
And bring everyone in this group me with yoyy.
Woody come to Canada for your honeymoon.
Pooping, eating, dota .
sucks to suck nerd.
Wedding, honeymoon, house.
Yes. I also want a new computer but yes also adult .
man i really want to buy a new computer but i dont want to spend money on a new computer. being an adult sucks.
lol woody said that.
Woody Zantzinger 2 changed name to Michael Desrosiers.
I smell like butts.
Michael Desrosiers changed name to Woody Zantzinger 2.
That's not nice. 
Hey Jon. Fuck you.
Matt how long are you hanging out with vikings .
neat.
Its a rainy day. I'm on my way home. Gonna pick up sushi and a hot and sour soup and watch Game of Thrones season 4 to prep for Sunday .
for =longer than you think/want.
because it stays in you.
you do.
Ugh you'd feel so inestimably foul after all those nugz.
I've eaten 50 chicken nuggets. It sucked. Greasy sponges.
grey sweats.
and jon is sweats.
*.
sweaty nugz.
loser wears a dunce cap for the rest of the day.
even cranking up the heat to full blast would suffice. wear two heavy winter coats. get a 50 piece chicken nugget.
that idea is fucking hilarious. I want to do it.
am i remembering wrong, or was the name sweaty nugs?
i still dont understand why that was ever an idea.
Hot Nugs was a dream of madmen, no living man has ever attempted the challenge. 
I played a game with Hobbes where the loser of each hole of golf had to wear a heavy winter jacket the whole time until they won a hole. Hot summer days and losing two holes in a row was debilitating.
zete is back apparently.
and tried to eat tons of fucking nuggets.
where you dressed in winter coats in a hot car.
How about that McNuggets game that you played woody and stu.
thats a softball for jokes.
That's like an instant way to pickle yourself.
when life gives ya soy sauce.
welp.
zeta psi or die is what you were thinking of mike.
Zete .
kappa psi or die.
annie's brothers old frat right?
I think they're back now? I dunno.
it was shut down i thought.
Nothing really.
Did that frat shut down?
whatever happened to that .

so that was cool.
neat.
i got to slap dollar bills on ones ass actually while she was going down on another stripper.
but thats all i have.
and another time one picked a 5 dollar bill off my face with her vagina.
i got jerked off by a stripper.
I'm pretty sure teddy had a war or two because of that.
You wont.
i long for the day someone in our generation becomes president and we start a war because the vice president says, "you wont".
Imagine if they took venmo or those square card transactions .
Cash works better with strippers.
Classic Eric.
peer pressure best pressure.
We did. I regret nothing.
Dragos pls respond.
is dragos a black guy in nawlinz.
dragos.
that was a happy man.
i did enjoy the one guy who was super super super into butts and just had the girl waggling it in his face while he just tossed billz at it.
Disclaimer: woody and Eric made me do everything that happened to me with strippers.
andy had some better experiences with that 'temptations' strip club but i don't think they were too wild.
Pls tell me you went to the clinic after Jon.
The whipped cream was a part of the strawberry. It was multipart.
Vivid smells.
Tied to pole for birthday. Strippers used me as pole.
no.
Did he sUN? #yesorno.

Woody what was it with whipped cream?
I didn't do that.
Licked out of butthole?
ok im appeased on strip club stories.
Sty...
Whipped cream.
Ate the candy.
The drilldo was for the crowd.
Picked up with vag.
Strawberry candy on nose.
Guys wtf.
Double sided dildo.
Never forget the glow stick.
Drilldo.

Glow stick.
Sty and I will beat anything you can suggest .
Fucked a stripper.

Fucking huge.

#sunstrike.
your mom.
What's the dirtiest thing you've ever done?
I once laid on the stage with a fin in my mouth and a stripped did the splits over me and grabbed it with her vadge.
i'm imagining you just sort of "teehee"-ing to yourself while doing it.
I was entertained.
Last time I was in a strip club I got to ball up dollar bills and use them as balls to shoot at a strippers vagina that she had a cup under.
also andy is wrong about the "little if any nudity". literally no nudity. i may as well have just picked up a victoria's secret catalog, but the special edition about looking really sad while nearly naked.
strippers are best with kind eyes. these had the opposite of kind eyes.
And also make me fall asleep.
Strip clubs make me sad.
like there was no soul left in the strippers. if thats the case, dark stuff andy, dark stuff.
define dead eyes.
place was sketchy.
lots of huka.
little if any nudity.
dead eyes.
were the milkshakes in the yard ass.
Why was that strip club so disappointing when we parted ways that night andy and mike.
Also it was foie gras, not any kind of butt.
Hearts all around.
Classis Eric.
shit was hilarious.
and then got boo'd by people walking by.
Also remember when Eric puked in that tree.

i didnt know it was foie gras.
good.
duck liver tho.

it wasn't duck anus.

I on a weekly basis have serious conversations about duck penises.
on the other hand, completely legitimate terms in my program were "shaft work",  and "pump head".

I had a prof who'd say "Poopa" instead of pupa. Laughs were had.
axe dont seem like a pot head; more like a meth head.
Also snoop dog is in Cville this weekend. I'm positive if we go the "tea bazzar " we will find him.
i had an italian professor who, instead of psi, said pussy all semester. 10/10 confusing.

#gif bird law.
BIRD LAW WHUDDUP.
Maritime Law for me.
*at this point in time.
i mean i'm basically an expert on bird law at this reason.
Also i'm talking out of my ass.
I think the defense for the bomber is trying to claim it was heavy influence of his brother who died. So the jury has to decide what the influence and aid probably was.
he does these on the nyc subway between stops.
my drawing instructor.
good work, jury.
>The second question was about the difference between aiding and 
abetting. The judge said aiding and abetting is a single concept, and 
that to aid and abet is to help someone intentionally commit a criminal 
offense. 
I dunno what i would do with a lifetime sentence in jail.
that drawing looks very amateurish.
i think he just has too much time on his hands so he can put a lot of wffort into trimming his beard.
He looks he's wearing one of those furry KGB hats.
also that artist made dzhohkar look evil as shit in that picture. devilishly-pointed facial hair and all.
im guessing they sketch the general shapes in the moment, then go back and color in it real detailed later.
Guessing, but im sure time is a factor so accuracy is more important than artistic representation .
Fried chicken.
I'm pretty sure he's gonna get fried .
Apparently they showed a picture of the bomber planting his bag next to a small child, paused to hear testimony from dead child's parents, showed video of bomb going off next to child then showed autopsy photos. 
why are courtroom artists only mediocre artists and why do they always use dry pastels.
http://iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/chatroulette-cleaning-shoe-cleaning-plate-looks-slightly-dodgey-cam-14183430580.gif?id=506.
i think ordinarily that would just be stalking.
in my photo class we learned about a guy that just followed a stranger around france for a week taking her picture.
God damn it thats good. Im imagining dragos furiously drawing in a tree .
you can get away with that.
its art.
So if I peeping tom a girls window, its OK as long as I draw a picture and not take a photograph.

I also guessed south america on the eastern european.
One of my favorite procrastination games.
That geoguessr quiz was fun.
yeah, i was really convinced that was brazil.
You and I both guessed south america on an eastern Europe.
"this road sure looks woodsy, i'm gonna say canada. No it was russia? ok fair enough game.".
haha, also a legit strat when there are no clues whatsoever.
I was just balls out guessing.
you basically explore til you see a sign or flag or something.
oh yeah thats huge.
Oh you can actually go down the roads? No wonder I'm getting smoked I thought you had to stay in one place.
Yeah Andy, thanks for nothing.
alright one more: https://geoguessr.com/challenge/Kp4dSIHXyvQPUAjP.
Damn wp.
and then i just guessed the biggest city and got lucky.
gotta look for details.
there was a chile flag.
damn andy how the fuck did you guess south america. you won the round soley on how fucking close you were there. south korea was a bad guess.
they buffed rift mana cost. i think you can cast 3x at level 1.
mike.
https://geoguessr.com/challenge/Ub6KrcnESOZg4BbV.
One neigh, run back to base.
No mana though.
and horse NEIGHS everywhere.
chaos knight would be funny because everyone would be getting pulled everywhere.
Will it be one, will it be four?!?
Chaos knight stuns.
4 ogres and 1 pugna.
Multicast out the ass.
Ogre Magi.
all axes would be the RNG-est inhouse.
10 axes.
spin2win.
5 axes.
4 dazzles and one axe.
4 dazzles and AA. perma grave.
Haha man, chilling touch then blink blow someone up.
i think i once was able to get force staff and blink dagger on qop. 10/10 fun.
4 anti mages and AA. Lots of blinking and slamming .
can't perma disrupt.
whats the duration and cd?
The amount of poison flying through the air.
with infinite mana could you keep him perma disrupted?
first team to kill the other AA wins.
AA and 4 Shadow demons.
AA is glass too.
probably CM.
i kind of want to figure out an inhouse that has a "protect the x". idk how we'd make it work. what's the slowest, most fragile hero?
yes.
ok so you do a round then send the challenge, got it.
i'll do it and send it to you.
how do we start another round.
fun though, right?
yeah.
i think you won by a little, that one in like norway was confusing as dick.

Jon and Matt and dragos don't much care for in house. We tried 3v3 ability draft last night and it went ok.
I think we now have 10 Dota players. Can we plan an in-house 5v5? Pick captains and draft the team then the heroes? When is everyone free to play dota?

if the answer is more than 0 you are an awful parent.
i feel like the second one is actually a pretty good benchmark.
"How many of my children were taken by ghosts".
I don't think "how quickly did my children discovery pornography" is the best benchmark for quality of parenting.
summary: i would be a terrible parent.
and thats how my kids will discover porn.
if i ever have kids, once they turn 8 i'm just gonna say "never ask me a question you haven't googled first".
thats how like 99% of questions can be answered.
We actually did help that guy. We googled "How to kill Willow trees" and sent him the top result.
Did you get to help kill willow trees.
alright, i guess if you ever decide to execute some app idea i have to agree by default to be a partner only to not risk being the guy who misses out on being a billionaire .
"Hi, how do we kill willow trees? When tree trimers cut down trees they used a greenish powder kind of stuff to kill the willow stump. Do you know what it is and where we can but it? Thanks".
Best inquiry we've ever had (this is a quote).
he had regrets.
lol.
I met someone who passed on being the 3rd partner for Instagram. Thought it was stupid.
Like most things, it is almost never the idea which makes something successful. Its the details in the execution. Most ideas suck when they are pitched.
because for me, most of the popular apps, if you pitched them to me in a vacuum sound stupid.
very very few.
also, how good are you guys at actually distinguishing good ideas from bad ones? do you ever make apps you think are a shitty idea but they end up being successful?
how many legitimately good app ideas do you get that dont get made because the person cant afford it?
I can pull some awesome customer reviews, I think we save them in a list somewhere. Also amazing app ideas people send us.
and she is basically an app.
Well I guess it isn't.
boom, sun knows.
you guys must have great customer service reviews.
no.

false. it says message didnt send (i have no idea why, i had service) and then it just tries to resend the message over and over until it succeeds. it does not give me the option to not send the message once i have already sent it through another medium (my computer). thats not user error, thats poor design.
As someone who works in apps, I can say it is 100% user error.

2.) It was a 3 v. 3
3.) That game doesn't count.
totally worth the nearly 6k gold.
phase shift + radiance is so next level. ez 162.5 damage and they can't even hurt you.
No. Rushed Dagon eblade. Didn't even blink or Euls .
did you have a midas at any point, and just sell it before the end?
:(.
andy's radiance prediction unsurprisingly comes true.

should i quit playing games with it?
yeah what about that andy.
How can I trust you when you're so reckless with my heart.
also makes it impossible for techies to drop his items to abuse soul ring or mana boots.
bounty is amazing as shit against techies. dude can just follow around the techies and note where the mines are, trust me i've seen it done in a bunch of games.
ez.
Disclosure: Brian is playing a puck game with two abandons on both sides. Gonna inflate the numbers.
i dont agree with axe or bounty lol.
techies is only effective if he's off the enemy vision.
also bounty is really good.
he's tanky enough that most early mine stacks dont kill him.
Axe??
and yeah ta is good too.
zeus, np, axe.
Yeah what hell brian.
yo fuck brian.
Srsly tho TA isn't half bad. Also Zeus and like sniper to destroy them.
4v5 Andy abandons.
lets say someone first picks Techies in an AP match. Who is the perfect Anti-techies team to draft in reponse?
Yeah that picture was nearly incoherent really.
i feel like mine would be moderately more articulate, but i agree with the sentiment .

also i think we've offically lost every other person in the chat.
jamie really screwed the pooch though.
i think i pulled my end of the bargain pretty well- abused substances with scooby.
we split up and i nailed daphne.
wait, we've done that already. how'd it work out for you.
jenkies gang.
because obviously i want that.
...is that a thing?
do you really want the additional challenge of a scooby-doo episode every time you try to hook up with a girl.
that sounds painful.
not the reverse corkscrew thing though.
ducks got it figured out.
yeah in retrospect, step up your game human females.
That would be a good thing andy.
and store pickled fish.
or secret compartments in their vaginas to avoid getting pregnant.
but what if finnish ladies have reverse-corkscrew genitalia to compensate.
Boom.
duck sex is hilarious.
Andy knows his duck anatomy.
matt pls.
bonus points if your penis corkscrews.
skankynavian girls?
"what do me and a duck have in common? We're both sexually aggressive and have disproportionately large genetailia".
i don't have any more puns for that.
also back to matt picking up hot finnish bitches.
yes ?
Dragos pls.
i want to afford it, but i dont have any money.
if you have to ask, you're not old enough for it.
is that like, a sex thing? whats the cherry?
thats more than im used to so ez mid.
dragos you're shooting like 50/50 for making sense.
he prob also goes bobbing for cherries more than you andy.

Andy I'm passing through a town called Epso. Is this where you live? Pls advise.
you need to come up with a really good pick up line.
i stand by my statement .
Both Kobe and sun say you're getting it in... We want pics.
dragos lost me.
wat.
the ones that trap you in when you go bobbing for cherries .
honest hips as they are known today.
i'm assuming they were into 'birthing hips', but i have no idea what those are.
those big burly dudes liked their chicks  tall and skinny; they were ahead of their times.
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
yes.
sUN, are any of these girls gonna let matt over the finnish line #yesorno.
"we'll steal you, you, you, not you, fuck no not you, annnnnnnnd you.".
well apparently only 5 of those were cute.
the reason scandanavian woman are attractive is because vikings had good taste.
I've fallen in love like 50 times so far.
http://i.imgur.com/qIJB5.gif.
#kobe how many cute finnish girls has matt checked out already?
as long as you have a sap to take the fall for you.
or maybe hallucinogens to commune with nature and truly be one with the duck .
........
one wrong move and you have yourself a sticky situation.
a maple syrup heist is pretty risky.
What's in Finland ? 
We got it back though.
and y'all got your maple syrup stolen in a huge heist anyways.
we have vermont for that.
What about all matters concerning maple syrup and other maple products?
i bet theres gonna be so much weed at matts conference.
I haven't seen it either.
on all other matters, great scrutiny is to be applied to canucks.
only because we're discussing hockey.
>Sorry!
he's canadian.
and you know you can trust matts opinion.

and just blow one up.

I agree. That's basically what she was saying. 
One talks mostly, other listens mostly. Obviously nothing crazy but just in general .
i think your mom just wanted to tell you to shut up.
How about this one, my mom told me there can only be one talker in a relationship. She said this cause I like to talk a lot and she's like, you should stop that. 
Also neither of us are really music people so it doesn't matter. 
love triangle.
Erika and I don't like the same music.
Sucks.
she then proceeded to break up with me to go back to dating her ex, who was also my lab partner.

really nice butt.
she actually is pretty hot; .
That means she wasn't hot.
i tried; she fought back with her annoying personality; she won.
You should like her more, not the music less.
i wonder if this happened to any of you; i work with this girl that i find annoying but she likes all themusic i like and plays it in the lab which ruined it for me; cant enjoy it anymore.
dragons pls.
Dragos your turn .
remix to ignition is mrs. zantzinger's favorite song.
Maybe remix to ignition or clarity.
I like andys stuff.
Yeah I knew Andy's was going to be one of those .
or maybe ms. hill by talib kweli.
probably something by lupe fiasco like daydreamin or dumb it down.
i think, at last check, the song i had played the most on itunes was "your ex-lover is dead" by stars.
(you're surrounded by hipsters).
I haven't hear of  of these.
what if your favorite song was seriously "ms new booty".
song enjoyment is so dependent on the mood and state of mind youre in that i find it hard to think there is one that covers everything.
Ats a good song too.
Shampoo Suicide by Broken Social Scene.
Somebody by Jeremiah natalie la rose.
ats a good song.

Decrep your stupid face.

No. Decrep the tombstone. So it can't be killed.
Or warlock undy.
CM undy better combo.
There are way better slows than decrep.
Pugna + undy lane. Decrep tombstone.

Also pugnas lore is awesome.
DAZZUL.
k, I agree.
mike may be right, but we should still check.
goes back to the dazzle thing.
also, i think we should have established by now that dota is a weird game and reading the wiki doesnt answer questions.
"most friendly effects such as healing and teleport are unaffected by invulnerability".
http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Keeper_of_the_Light.
http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Invulnerability.
it heals for 75% of 500 i think'.
also invulnerable doesnt necesarily mean the heal wont work we shold still try just in case.
I think armlet is one.
items.
jugg.
for sure.
jugg.
wd?
need 1 more.
So LC huskar chen warlock.
he's right, OD counts as invulnerable.
Our internet is down at work so I'm all group chat right meoa.
because it would heal more than lc.
idk if mike is right on that one and i think we should check.
k yea.
Can't be hit.
OD is off map in astral.
does illuminate heal in astral?
what about kotl?
no.

Phx banned.
4% max hp per second.
Also forgot about urn.
waht about sun ray?
Meecro.
Drop item, eat tango, pick up item.
Tango, lol. 
Bottle urn mek salve are probably the only useful items on allies.
wasn't speicified on merlini's page btu probably in comments.
I know you can use in fountain, but i figured it would be less than a scythe would be so i was wondering if it made more sense to grab rune or be in fountain.
k.
No enemies.
Can't have another team.
use two abiltiies?
an you have an aghs rubick.
so this is perfect meecro.
wait.
Works then.
Can wait for regen rune to expire.
Its while od is imprisoned.
One hero can pop cheese for that instant 2500 hp lol.
You cant activate it though.
You don't have to choose between rrgen rune and fountain. Can bottle and use IN fountain.
Guys lol cheese was not restricted btw.
WW no BC you can't astral self.
100 health per second.
What does more regen rune or fountain?
Regen rune? Would that matter on od? Or does it do less than other items.
I hadnt thought of bottle, but just one.
or just one bottle possible?
also everyone has bottle.
WW woudlnt work?
mek and pipe and headdress don't stack.
Oh didn't read all the rules.
Oracle banned.
Btw was wyvern or oracles increase to healing thought of by anyone???
you need 6 items on OD.
Someone needs a mek, a pipe, and a headdress.
you would just explain aghs on chen.
ooh okay you dont need to list items on allies.
Many things are outright forbidden.
forgot.
oh it is.
Read merlinis rules pls.
Bloodstone against the rules i think.
does it heal?
while OD is astral.
if an ally dies with bloodstone.
Ok, so chen has an ancient golem, and a satyr meaning he has an aghs as well. His heal is a burst heal for 400.
decrep does nothing.
no pugna, ult doesnt work on astralled hero.
to use heal.
slash e blade on an ally.
ult and/or would decrep help?
(yes).
also what about pugna?
52 --> 37 or something.
not sure if this was mentioned but stolen int decreases during astral.
Fuck you warlock.
Ok, thats the 5th then i guess.
Fuck i keep forgetting about lc.
legion is 60 heal/s.
probably.
Doesnt go through i assume.
pugna butt pump.
And woody is right, halfway through he'd lose one int stack.
And imprisonment duration is 4sec.
Alright so unless someone thinks of another hero those are the 5.
Yeah sounds like it.
Od int = 26 + 3.3*25.
warlock winz.
tree's second heal does not go through astral.
voodoo = 40/s, armor = 13/s, shadow word = 45/s.
Also tree has two heals, but do the leech seed pulses go through astral?
My guess is wd, but idk for sure.
Who heals most: wd, tree, warlock?
For now, who is the 5th hero though?
105 int + 6 * 35 int from sheeps is 325 int, + 13 * 4 astral steal = 377 int.
Yeah we have to basically solve it for a few different combos.
fuck you math.
or go skadis to get more HP and also get a good amount of int for regen.
i guess you start having to balance how many hearts to max out HP, vs how many sheeps to max regen.
So if 6 scythes get you to full, then it might be better to throw in a heart.
The other thing is seeing how much hp od has with the items. Hearts will give you a higher cap if you can get close to it.
but the int will expire in Astral, which effects huskars heal (it auto updates).
some math is about to get hard, OD can use astral 4 times before the 1st INT steal expires.
can't you just stack sheeps then and huskar's heal will eclipse everything else?
So we have to do the math, with huskar heal and heart heal is it better to have 6 hearts, 1 heart and 5 sythe or 1 heart and 5 skadi.
And skadi gives 25 of each.
Vs 30 for shivas.
35.
Nvm its sheep.
not sheep?
Let me check.
Shivas gives most int i think.
hearts do not stack but you get more heals for having more having more health.
let me know if that link is working for you.
does heart healing stack?
so he just has to pick them up.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18TmimSohagbGnq47JHh9NARn7ECKdfdulDqcjD_DUes/edit?usp=sharing.
I think so.
wait can you pickup heart and have it be off cooldown like tranquils?
...from enemy heros?
At least one heart definitely. But then calculate the tradeoff between more int and more strength.
"under sustained fire".
Heart would be on Cooldown, its a bad buy.
And we may have to adjust his items from 6 hearts to some skadis or int items.
Assume max stolen int on od.
We need one more.
+ 160.
So jugg huskar and chen are the definitely in ones.
it is 1280% of primary attribute.
Oh holy shit, so definitely huskar.
setting up a google spreadsheet for teamwork....
I didnt either, one sec.
because huskar sucks in 99% of drafts and games.
I didn't realize Huskar worked like that.
Like fountain or heart it doesnt make sense to drop items.
so assume he has max stolen and tons of Int items.
Percent it doesnt help.
Huskar's heal is better based on Intellgince on OD?
Like bottle.
so you can have cake and eat it too.
"Unlocks the regenerative power of a friendly unit, with healing based upon its primary attribute.".
Only foe set regen.
woah.
i think its like dropping items for regen, generally goes faster.
If you could time the ticks right for the number based heals you could move it back and forth.
neither does your mom.
But that doesnt max percent heals.
move golem in at last second.
Mana and Health regeneration provided by the fountains is 4% maximum HP 
or Mana per second plus an additional 14 Mana points per second.
Whats the best way to use the golem though? Have it in range the whole time to max the percent based heals, or move it away and then back to maximize set number heals.
http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/30y1ky/od_theorycrafting_puzzle_2x_arcana_to_the_winner/.
Isn't it obvious? Pudge fountain hook back to your own fountain.
yeah, why not.
also in the comments from the reddit post, merlini mentioned fountian regen is possible?
And chen's heal probably is probably good too.
people also were discussing armlet.
that would be OP as fuk.
damn.
Doesnt stack.
doesnt stack.
you oculd even bring in 3.
ancient golem is smart smart smart.
There arent that many.
bring in ancient golem.
The items arent an issue.
I was thinking possibly chen.
assuming perfect meecro.
and swap right before STACHE.
and you can technically have more than 6.
also they are lvl 25 and each hero gets any 6 items.
http://www.merlinidota.com/content/puzzles/odstache/.
(I don't know what we're talking about).
enchy doesnt do astra.
Dp ult doesnt work.
DP ult heals dp, dummy.
DP ult.
Idk if mek does it might.
kotl aghs won't hit in astral i bet.
someone who can load dota can check.
Kotl aghs.
Do the butterfly things go through astral?
enchantress.
Obviously jugg because percent based.
Goddamnit. Alright now we have to figure out which 4 does the most.
legion.
treant but i dont think his heals much.
Anyone wanna do the math?
Alright, so the team is od, huskar, jugg, wd, warlock.
Warlock.
The only heals over time i can think of that are targeted would be huskars and wynter wyvern.
Like if you target him first and then the heal hits.
Idk if necros thing goes through od imprisonment.
And wd.
Jugg aura also.
Big satyr creep also gives aura health regen so you would want a dominated creep or doom.
Items that give health auras: pipe, headdress, mek.
Regen from multiple HoT do not stack, but you still might want more than one to increase the percentage based heal from the item.
Sty: the answer is -1, its a trick question. No one can escape Axe's dunk.
Also secret and vp polar playing bo5 now.

also she is like chief counsel for the beer institute (http://www.beerinstitute.org/).
obviously.
cus she knows better than to mix weed and alcohol.
best part is that she actually never even drinks at all.
"going to see my aunt mary jane this weekend".
I just don't want to get sued.
mike, you have friends who've thought you were way cooler than you were.
I don't care if the university gets sued.
you're not jon. you can't use cooldog.
best part is andy and I arnt lawyers yet, so if were wrong and you and your company are sued, then nobody can sue us �.
i have an aunt whose name is "Mary Jane". so we call her aunt mary jane. it has taken me 24 years to finally find this hilarious.
Can you ever have sex with someone who is mute and illiterate because they can't give consent? 1 in 4 didn't cover this very relevant edge case.
you won't.
but yes.
so it's less of a gift and more of a paper insult.
no, because I know they're a bitch.
would it be reasonable to expect that they will use it?
or use it for bartering.
hey could give it to someone else if they wanted.
I figured that I'm not forcing them to assume the risk of skydiving, because it's just a gift certificate.
they have to sign anyway to skydive.
then they are a waver.
they'll sign a waiver at the skydiving place.
they just have to wave AT you.
have them sign a waiver.
are you getting at the doctrine of respondient superior?
'acting'.
I'm acting as an employee of UTK.
another ez mid by lawyer Woody.
IF THEY DIE IT IS YOUR FAULT.
I'm buying a gift certificate for skydiving as a prize to give away to a student.
Stu mine was also a real life question.
actually I have a real life law question .
not if you consent.
just probable cause...and lube.
Do police need a search warrant for things you hide in your butt? A Butt Warrant if you will?
police didnt come yet.
Well mike, bob was just drunk, he wasnt really in trouble.
Just submit the song as your memorandum.
So shame on him now.
write an objective memorandum about all possible claims and defenses. kthxbye.
shame on him.
Jon should have known Bob was trouble when he walked in.
and then you have like 30 things to write about.
its not "can jon sue bob?" its name all the claims and possible defenses.
my mistake, please fill it in.
brian you're forgetting the best part of the questions.
The classic assumption of the risk defense.
Jon knew the risk when he alked by.
Yes. Ez mid.
its like bob hit mike in the face bc he was drunk and mike is a little bitch, then mike had a heat attack and shit himself, Jon alked by and slipped on the shit and slipped and broke his pelvic bone. Can Jon sue Bob?
Sample Torts questions are the best.
So does my boss.
Law school fact patterns throw a lot of unimportant facts in the questions to try and throw you off.
Wait did Joe strike the tree using the car, or mike?
Andy's ready.
He's right.
then no.
Oak.
what kind of tree?
I'm helping practice!
Both Joe and Mike are injured. Does Mary's auto insurance cover them?
Mary and Joe are divorced and share custody of their Son Mike. Joe borrows Mary's car to take Mike to a baseball game but arrived visibly intoxicated. Mary ignores this fact and still lends Joe the car and he hits a tree with the son.
This is why Andy is in Law School.
e) when someone cant handle the truth.
d) always.
c) when you should.
b) sometimes.
a) never.
when should you yell objection?
im trying to do practice bar exam questions and my group me is blowing up with mike and andy sex hypos... lol.
I generate an immense amount of power.
Ez power bottom.
Clearly I was the only one brave enough to make a suggestion...
obviously Mike.

"JONATHAN WE SAID WE TOOK THIS JOB TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE".

http://media0.giphy.com/media/TlK63EWnqdNkUbHi9cQ/giphy.gif.
i thought you just merged a bunch of your already-existing personalities.
for you.
I changed my identity!
gosh so pushy.
all I did was replace the bot id.
<3.
you think we can commit to this? i'm pulled a lot of directions. i should really checkout the differences.
<3.
then i better git going.
yea.
ah, i need to do the git side of things.
Accept Stu's change, push new code. Bam!
No. I just updated the GroupMe and Heroku side of things.
did you accept the pull requests? is that what you did?
I did that already, just need you to push the new bot to Heroku.
i'll push the updates but i can't really debug it today.
doesn't some work need to be done on heroku or something to hook it up to the API? i thought we had to specify what URL to point the bot at the make it work.
and Yes.
Yes.
also does anyone else use slack? our new IT guy wants us using it but it just had a huge security breach, about which i lol'd.
is working theory that if i accept the pull requests sUNbot will be operational again?
http://imgur.com/gallery/987v5wK.

It's cool, I like the new sUN bot better anyway.

Stu Steen changed the group's avatar.
its like if someone sent a ton of pictures of woody to this gruop, i'd shut it down.
you send a ton of pictures of a thing someone hates, you're gonna get them mad.
fine.
Then no sUN.
andy owes no apologies.
i;d rather die.
And posts a picture of a spooky spider.

I will bring sUN back only when Andy apologizes .
i found that out because my original plan was to leave the group.
£NOOO.
no gifs, no freedom.
Sausage. 
there is no sUN bot here.
10/10 follow through.
What.
no, the king of the group can shut it down. you kept sending spider pictures; andy shut it down, as he promised he would.
Andy deleted the group.
just the creator.
Jon say sausage.
I'm lost too.
So wait anyone can just destroy a group?
Don't do this to me.
